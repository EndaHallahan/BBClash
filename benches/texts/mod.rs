Dear journal,\r\n\r\n    How does a pony affect the world around her? Does she play an active part in the community? Does she work closely with individuals, or does she work from the shadows, pulling strings from a distance?\r\n\r\n    What if she can do neither of these things? What if she still wishes to make the world a better place for everypony she knows and loves? What if those whom she cares about could never know a single thing she's done, good or bad, to properly thank her for the motivation to begin with?\r\n\r\n    I'm rediscovering a truth. In this village that serves as my prison, and on the fringes of a haunted landscape between the firmaments, I'm starting to grasp something that was taught to me long ago, but only now makes sense.\r\n\r\n    Improving the world is not always about adding things to it, or removing important factors. Construction and destruction are simply means of shifting around the elements that are at our disposal. It's far too easy to forget that we ourselves are factors that mold and shape this universe, and oftentimes the best way to solve a problem—or at least understand it—is by simply being there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [i][color=green]It is suddenly storming. I don't think I will make it home in time to stay dry. I'm running and running as fast as I can. Gaaah! Slippery puddles! Gotta be careful. Mommy's gonna be mad at me for ruining my mane. Of all the worst times to go outside...\r\n\r\n    There's a flash of lightning. I hear myself shriek and I gallop faster through the rain-slicked streets of Canterlot. I can see my apartment up ahead. Oh sweet Celestia, I am so soaked!\r\n\r\n    I come to a stop in the stairwell to my home, skidding into the shadows. I bump into a wall and wince. I don't realize how cold I am until right now. I shiver in the crook of the alcove, watching as streams of rain trickle down from the overhang above. The planted trees and flower gardens along the sidewalk are being flooded in the ugly, gray weather.\r\n\r\n    “Ohhhhhh...” I moan. I look at the candied cone levitating in my telekinesis and pout at the sight of all the ice cream having washed away. “Unnnngh!” I moan again, stamping a green hoof. “And I just gave away my only two bits!”\r\n\r\n    I turn the cone over and over in my magical grasp. There's another boom of thunder, but it no longer frightens me. With a dull spirit, I lean forward and lightly nibble on the edge of the cone. It's soaked and soggy and thoroughly ruined by rainwater, but a tiny piece beneath it all is still sweet. I suckle on the sensation, hoping it will prepare me for the tongue lashing I'm about to get from Mommy. With a heavy sigh, I trudge up the steps of the stairwell towards my apartment door on the second story.\r\n\r\n    I hear something. It's different from the rain and my hoofsteps and the thunder. I stop in my tracks, feeling thunder again, this time in my chest, for I realize that the odd sound is coming from directly beneath me. Slowly, I squat down and peer through the gap between the steps, curious as to the source of the labored whimpers and sobs.\r\n\r\n    It is then that I see her, curled up in the corner, shadowed from the rain and lightning. She's small, about my age, only tinier than me. She doesn't have a cutie mark either. I can't see her face from all of the red and violet tangles of wet mane hair muffling her cries.\r\n\r\n    For some reason, I'm not afraid. I swallow the cone whole and nearly gag. “Bleachk... Tastes like cardboard!”\r\n\r\n    I giggle at myself, but the filly doesn't laugh one bit. She's too busy crying. It's like she doesn't even know that I'm here.\r\n\r\n    “Hello?” I march quietly down the steps and move towards her, smiling. “Did you get caught in the rain too? It's all because of those lazy pegasi! Ugh! I wonder if this happens everyday in Cloudsdale. Heehee! What do you think?”\r\n\r\n    She says nothing. She shivers, hugging herself and curling even further into the deepest part of the corner. She's wetter than I am. How long has she been out in the rain?\r\n\r\n    “Hey, are you okay?” I say as I squat down in front of her. “Are you sad because you got your mane all wet? Well, don't worry. I'm sure it's very pretty. You have some nice colors. Me?” I smile and toss my head left and right, allowing the gray and turquoise strands to whip about. “I could blend in at a greenhouse. Heeheehe! That's such a funny word, 'greenhouse!' It's not even green until you walk inside!”\r\n\r\n    She still doesn't say anything, but I think she's noticing me. She lowers her forelimbs and tilts her face up. I see a pair of eyes. One's violet. The other one's violet and... blue? No, wait... what's wrong with her face?\r\n\r\n    “What's wrong with your face?” I ask. I then bite my lip, blushing. “Erm, I mean... did you hurt yourself?”\r\n\r\n    She gulps, trembling as a flash of lightning catches a bruise on her cheek. “I...” She speaks, and it is a very gentle sound, like icicles snapping. “I b-bumped into something trying to get out of the st-storm,” she says.\r\n\r\n    I make a face. “Bumped into something? You're a unicorn, not some bumbling earth pony!”\r\n\r\n    “I'm... v-very clumsy,” she stammers.\r\n\r\n    I think that's very silly, but it doesn't matter. It's been a lonely weekend, and she looks like she could use a friend. “My name is Lyra,” I introduce myself properly, as Mommy always tells me to. “Lyra Heartstrings. What's your name?”\r\n\r\n    She looks at me, and for a moment her trembles stop. “Uhm...” She bites her lip before ultimately confessing, “Moondancer. My name is Moondancer.”[/color][/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I took several heavy breaths, finding my center, steeling myself for the freezing waves to come. When they finally hit, I was ready for them, but it didn't make the experience any less excruciating. As soon as [i]“Twilight's Requiem”[/i] was finished, I tilted my head back and clung tighter to the Nightbringer. When my hooves landed on the rusted platform, it was like touching death itself. A bitter shiver ran up my spine, culminating in my skull as my eyes were forced open in a determined glare.\r\n\r\n    Before me, the [color=purple]unsung realm[/color] billowed with lightning and twirling tendrils of water. Constellations of rusted chains undulated towards and away from my body as the platform I stood on spun perpetually in the chaotic nether. As soon as I breathed, and my vaporous exhales lit the cold hellscape, shackled ponies crawled like spiders out of their metallic holes, shuffling blindly towards me on the lengths of their rattling fetters.\r\n\r\n    I did not fear them. After all, [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color] was gone, and they weren't the ones I journeyed here to speak with. Gripping the Nightbringer tighter, I ran a hoof along its onyx strings. A high tone lit the tempestuous air, and a sphere of golden energy encased me. The[color=purple] unsung[/color] ponies trotted as far as they could, ultimately colliding with the translucent barrier and banging their tormented limbs against it. I stared past them, shouting into the thunderous, cyclonic heavens.\r\n\r\n    “Do not hide from me!” I exclaimed, my voice echoing above the anguished moans and ringing of metal. “[color=purple]You[/color] are a goddess! I am a but a mortal, equipped with a piece of the same song that bound [color=purple]you[/color] here! Show [color=purple]yourself[/color]! Show [color=purple]yourself[/color] and be my audience!”\r\n\r\n    Only thunder and turbulence answered me. I felt a gale of wind surging across the platform. Several [color=purple]unsung[/color] equines flew off into the nether while the Nightbringer's barrier fluctuated, but I did not budge an inch.\r\n\r\n    “I am not leaving until I see [color=purple]you[/color]!” I bellowed bravely, gnashing my teeth into the frigid winds and moisture. I held tight to the Nightbringer's golden body as if it was a lost child. Its ancient energy and presence served as my anchor while I clung to the bones of forgotten chaos. “Do not... nnngh—” I hissed and summoned an angry vibration from the center of my being. “—do not confuse this with a request! Show [color=purple]yourself[/color]! Now!”\r\n\r\n    Just then, the heavens parted. A surging arch of water dissipated with a blast, like a bomb going off beneath the surface of a gigantic ocean. The moans around me doubled, quadrupled, as the shackled ponies prostrated themselves across the platform and moaned into their twitching limbs. I looked straight up in time to have my vision devoured by runes.\r\n\r\n    There it was, [color=purple]her[/color] home, [color=purple]her[/color] floating fortress on high. The spheres within spheres rotated towards me, like a globe of spiraling menace. Runes blurred over one another as the round sarcophagus loomed closer overhead, brimming with violet beams of pulsating energy. I heard deep bass noises, and soon sharp salvos of unbridled sound reverberated off the archaic throne, sending rivulets of energy barreling through the cloud of moisture above the platform.\r\n\r\n    The squirming ponies all around me mimicked [color=purple]her[/color] epic cry with moans. I broke through the chorus with a snarling voice, “No! I will not sing [color=purple]your[/color] song!” There were two more claps of thunder, but I sensed it was [color=purple]her[/color] this time and not the realm. “I will not become nothing!”\r\n\r\n    Then [color=purple]she[/color] fired the first volley. A bolt of lightning rocketed towards me, sending a wall of sparks surging along the platform. The equine bodies caught flame in a screaming second. When the energy reached me, it splashed off the Nightbringer's shield with the sound of dying bells.\r\n\r\n    I gritted my teeth and held my ground. “Join me!” I strummed a few strings and strengthened the shield against [color=purple]her[/color] furious discharge. “I've learned the ninth elegy! I've memorized '[i]Desolation's Duet[/i]!' [color=purple]You[/color] know this!”\r\n\r\n    The spheres spun faster. Twin bolts of lightning flew my way.\r\n\r\n    The golden shield pulsed around me, staving off the white hot energy blasts as the platform started to melt from the heat. “Join me in the instrumental!” I shrieked against [color=purple]her[/color] fury. The spherical fortress was starting to float away, and my voice cracked in desperation as I implored [color=purple]her[/color], “How many times do I have to tell [color=purple]you[/color]?! I don't care about this realm! I don't care about this secret! We can finish the Nocturne together, and I can move on! Release me from this curse, and I won't bother [color=purple]you[/color] ever again! Please, help me! I must learn ‘[i]Dawn's Advent[/i]!’”\r\n\r\n    The spheres within spheres were indiscernible now; ll I could see was smoke and rain. The [color=purple]alicorn goddess[/color] was gone.\r\n\r\n    “I must learn it...” I whimpered, hanging my head. I was alone, now more than ever. “I m-must get home.”\r\n\r\n    All traces of [color=purple]her[/color] were gone. Even the thunder had dwindled. I started to hear the whimpers of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] ponies stirring up again. I knew better than to wait for another appearance. With a sigh, I regripped the Nightbringer and telekinetically played a new tune. “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i]” lit the purgatorial realm with its heavenly notes, and soon everything was blurring away as if a cosmic hoof was wiping a chalkboard clean. The moans flew into obscurity, as did the moisture, the lightning, the chains, and the bone-chilling cold. The world settled into a gentle amber kiss, and I was once again sitting on my stool in the bottom of a cellar, surrounded by dirt walls and lanternlight.\r\n\r\n    The Nightbringer hung in my grasp. I looked at my moist hooves as I cradled it. Not a single limb of mine was shivering; it made very little difference. With a defeated moan, I closed my eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Ten times, Al,” I said, squatting in the center of the cabin as I tossed another wooden log into the fireplace. “I've played the first eight elegies and taken myself to the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm ten times in a single week, and still I can't get [color=purple]her[/color] to show [color=purple]herself[/color].” I threw in another log, sighing as it suffered a crackling fate amidst the burning embers. In a lethargic slump, I stretched my wet limbs towards the center of the tranquil furnace and warmed myself. “Just what am I doing wrong? I mean, I have the Nightbringer; I have a piece of the same song that created [color=purple]her[/color]. Why can't [color=purple]she[/color] recognize that? Why can't [color=purple]she[/color] face me like a responsible goddess so I can simply end this?”\r\n\r\n    Behind me was the sweetest sound in the whole world. A tiny orange thing was purring, his rumbling sounds punctuated by the crackling of dry food between his jaws as he patiently ate from his freshly filled bowl beside my cot. Tilting his head up, Al glanced at me with calm, amber eyeslits before returning to his food. The tabby's ears pricked at attention, as if knowing I was only going to ramble on. Smart cat.\r\n\r\n    “Maybe that's just it. Maybe [color=purple]she[/color]'s just mad at me for having received the Nightbringer from [color=cornflowerblue=]Alabaster[/color] right under [color=purple]her[/color] nose.” I sighed as I gazed up at the cool October evening from beyond the windows of my home. “Maybe [color=purple]she[/color]'s always been mad at the Cosmic Matriarch, and now that I've gotten a piece of her voice, [color=purple]she[/color] won't even give me the light of day...” I chuckled bitterly. “Or of chaotic day. Seriously, that stupid place could use a flashlight.” I gave Al a goofy smile.\r\n\r\n    The cat merely stared back at me, his whiskers twitching.\r\n\r\n    I winced. “Yeah, okay, that was lame.” With a groan, I stood up and marched my rain-slicked self towards the far side of the cabin. “Still, ten times in a row? And it's not like [color=purple]she[/color]'s [i]completely[/i] ignoring me. I mean, [color=purple]she[/color] appears in [color=purple]her[/color] huge spheroid throne every time to try and scare me away. Just what is that thing, anyways? Was it a means of transportation for alicorns upon the dawn of creation? That would make some sense, right? I mean, [color=purple]she[/color] had to have been around as long as the Cosmic Matriarch was here on this planet, right? [color=purple]She[/color] couldn't be any older than Celestia, at the very least...”\r\n\r\n    I levitated a towel from a shelf and dried my mane vigorously with it. As I dragged the rag to my wet shoulders and spine, repeating the motions I had gotten far too used to over the past week, I paused. I dropped the towel around me and looked Al's way through a disheveled mane.\r\n\r\n    “What if... What if that structure is part of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] prison?” I gulped and gazed out the window yet again. “And maybe... maybe the sphere does the same thing to [color=purple]her[/color] as the curse does to me. Maybe [color=purple]she[/color]'s powerless to remember anything but [color=purple]her[/color] song.” A shudder ran through me upon contemplating that. “Blessed Luna, do I even have a chance of reaching [color=purple]her[/color]?”\r\n\r\n    Al's answer was to hop onto the cot, curl in the dead center, and proceed to lick himself.\r\n\r\n    I exhaled. I dried the rest of my body before tossing the towel into a nearby hamper. “Well,” I murmured as I trotted across the light of the fireplace, “perhaps what I need to do is more studying. I sure have enough books checked out from Twilight's. Heh...” I chuckled as I looked upon a huge stack of research manuscripts lying beside Al's food dish. “At this rate, she and Spike will think that Diamond Dogs raided their archives overnight. I should return these soon. But still...”\r\n\r\n    I pivoted and stared at the source of an immense golden glow in my cabin. The Nightbringer stood on an end table, blessing this mortal equine with its timeless presence. It was a little bit alarming how easily I had gotten used to seeing the holy artifact with my naked eyes.\r\n\r\n    “There are bigger things at stake here,” I murmured. A frail smile crossed my lips. “What do you think it'll be like, Al, the day I finally get [color=purple]her[/color] to play the duet with me? The day I finally end this curse?” I turned and gazed softly towards him. “Would Celestia and Luna be grateful to have me return their holy instrument to them?”\r\n\r\n    Al looked towards me, blinking sleepily. His ears twitched, and he shook his head into one of those prolonged, devilishly freakish yawns that only felines can pull off.\r\n\r\n    “Hmmm...” I gazed at the floor as I trotted towards the bed. “Curious thought...” I murmured aloud as I levitated a brush and comb over to myself along with one of the library books. “The curse couldn't possibly be affecting [color=purple]her[/color]. I mean, [color=purple]she[/color] reached out to [color=purple]her[/color] sister when Luna osmotically learned about the '[i]Nocturne of Firmaments[/i]' and transformed into Nightmare Moon those many years ago.”\r\n\r\n    I squatted in the crater of blankets beside Al while brushing the tangles out of my mane. I flipped the page open and looked over several historical documents detailing Canterlot music tradition.\r\n\r\n    “Also, there is [color=purple]her[/color] beloved. For [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color] to have learned about the topic, [color=purple]she[/color] had to have been missing him, and thus had to be retaining memory of [color=purple]her[/color] beloved's banishment.” I frowned slightly as I levitated another book towards me, then another. My amber eyes danced across the many pages in search of an answer. “So I can’t really imagine that [color=purple]she[/color] is forgetting me each time I visit the realm, but instead [color=purple]she[/color]'s just flat-out ignoring me. But why? Does [color=purple]she[/color] think it's [color=purple]her[/color] job? Does [color=purple]she[/color] just want to break contact with any pony who's not willing to become [color=purple]her[/color] shackled slave?”\r\n\r\n    I felt a soft, furry body of warmth. I glanced down to see Al curling up against me, raising two playful paws to bat at the many floating objects.\r\n\r\n    Blankly, I stared at the books, books, books, brush, comb, and other objects crowded around my side of the room. With a nervous chuckle, I lowered everything in place except for one book which I propped up beside myself and Al.\r\n\r\n    “Thanks. I know, I know. I'm starting to overdo it again.” A sigh escaped my lips as I looked up from the pages and once again graced the Nightbringer's golden brilliance. “Seems like I've gotten stronger overnight. I think whatever it was that kept [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color] alive for so long is happening to me. I mean, I don't know about having long life, but I certainly feel [i]stronger[/i].” I gulped nervously. “And... And I know I wouldn't have lasted a second against [color=purple]her[/color] if I didn't have a piece of the holy song with me in the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm.” I squatted down and nuzzled Al closely. “But still,” I murmured. “I'd gladly give up all the strength in the world if it just means learning '[i]Dawn's Advent[/i],' if it just means finishing this blasted symphony.”\r\n\r\n    The cabin was silent, save for the crackling of embers in the fireplace. I felt warm, toasty, safe, anything but free.\r\n\r\n    “The powers of a goddess at my hooves...” I muttered, “And I can't get a single [color=purple]alicorn[/color] to listen to me.” I sighed and buried my face into the blankets. “Mmmmff... How will I ever receive an audience?”\r\n\r\n    Al mewed and rubbed up against me, purring.\r\n\r\n    Limply, I smiled and nudged him back. “I know, I know. But of course, I already got you, ya fuzzhead!” I giggled lightly and relished in his affectionate purr. “I promise, if there's an encore, you're the first one who's gonna hear it.” I stared calmly into the haze at the far ends of the room. The sunset fell outside the windows, and the hush of evening lulled me into a reflective trance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [i][color=green]“Could you repeat that, dearie?” Mommy asks with a gentle look of concern across her face. I don't know what her problem is. We're both absolutely fine.\r\n\r\n    “Mmm...” My new friend treads at the floor with her hooves. She avoids my parents' gaze. I don't understand why she's so shy. She's no more wet than I am. The storm is still brewing outside our Canterlot apartmet. Maybe she's frightened by it? I don't know. I step through the puddle and stand in front of her, smiling.\r\n\r\n    “She bumped into something along the way here!” I say with a proud smile. “She might be clumsy, but I think she's okay! Isn't her mane pretty? I mean, I know it's tangled and all now, but just wait until it gets dry! She was telling me earlier how much she loves going to the salon with her mom! Can I go with them sometime? It's just a block away! They don't live that far away from us! Heehee! We've been neighbors and we didn't even know it!”\r\n\r\n    “Is that so?” Daddy remarks. He glances across the way at Mommy.\r\n\r\n    Mommy is already stepping forward. She gently pats my shoulder and makes me step aside as she kneels down in front of my brand new friend. “Moondancer, was it...?”\r\n\r\n    She slowly nods her head. Why's she so shy in front of them? She was chatting like crazy a second ago. She likes banana splits and practical jokes and sunny days at the beach and—\r\n\r\n    “Let me see your face, darling,” Mommy says softly. She isn't angry at us. That's a relief. Why's she so curious about Moondancer's face? “You don't have to be afraid, dear. I won't hurt you, I promise.”\r\n\r\n    Moondancer takes a deep breath. Her face is wet, even though we marched in from the rain minutes ago. She tilts her horn up and allows Mommy to see her twitching eye.\r\n\r\n    “My, that's quite a nasty bruise you got there,” Mommy coos. She presses the side of Moondancer's face. The blueness on my new friend's skin is slightly larger than Mommy's hoof. “Mmmm... Sweet Celestia...” She turns and gives Daddy a pointed look.\r\n\r\n    He's nodding for some reason. Grabbing a coat and an umbrella, he marches towards the door, passing just beside Mommy to whisper something into her ear. She nods and murmurs something back. I eventually hear: “Don't go alone. Get Dusk to go with you. He should be home; I saw his and Stellar's son, Shining Armor, playing in the courtyard this morning.”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, I believe Dusk has dealt with Nightrot before. Don't worry, honey. We'll have the Guard with us this time,” Daddy says quietly. He casts me and Moondancer a brief smile. For some reason, it makes me feel nervous. He opens the door, shoots the umbrella open, and is gone in the storm. Before I can gaze out the window after him, Mommy is standing before us, and she also has that strange-looking smile.\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer, we're so glad to have you here to visit. It's a nasty storm outside, so we're going to let you stay here for the night.”\r\n\r\n    “I, uhm... I...” Moondancer's eyes flicker with bright violet, then blink. She fidgets, backtrotting and lowering her head as if part of the ceiling might fall on her. “I... I don't think my dad will like that...”\r\n\r\n    “Shhh...” Mommy talks to Moondancer in a gentle voice. It's like how she used to talk to me when I was just a little, itty bitty foal. “We won't tell your dad unless you want us to.” Her yes are trained on Moondancer.\r\n\r\n    Just like that Moondancer responds, “Uhm... You... You can tell my Mom.”\r\n\r\n    Mommy slowly nods. “Your mother, hmm?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmmhmmm.” Moondancer nods back, and she's trembling again, only this time her eyes are bright and happy. “Could... Could she stay the night too?”\r\n\r\n    Mommy smiles gently. “Don't you worry. Your mother can come here and stay as long as she likes as well...”\r\n\r\n    “Woohoo!” I jump, gasping for joy. “Slumber party! I've always wanted to have one! Oooh! Oooh! I can show you my room! Daddy bought me all of these amazing musical instruments! I'm gonna be in a band someday!”\r\n\r\n    “Lyra, dear,” Mommy chides gently. “Moondancer needs some time to rest and relax. Calm down some—”\r\n\r\n    “I... I uhm...” Moondancer bites her lip and squirms where she stands. “I don't mind. I like Lyra. She's fun.”\r\n\r\n    “See, Mommy?” I hop in place, beaming. “She likes me! She's my new best friend and we're gonna do fun stuff together!”\r\n\r\n    Mommy takes a breath before saying with a warm smile, “Okay. Go on and show her your room. Just don't get too rowdy. It'll be bedtime soon.”\r\n\r\n    “Okay! We won't be too loud, I promise!” I tug Moondancer by the hoof and all but drag her into my room. “Come on! Come on! You gotta see all the cool things I got for Hearth's Warming!”\r\n\r\n    Moondancer giggles. She makes such sweet sounds. I bet she's also going to have a talent in music. How lucky could we be? Maybe we'll both get matching cutie marks. I hear of ponies who get their cutie marks at the same time. Maybe she can join my band when I grow up?\r\n\r\n    “Lookie! Lookie!” I bounce around my room, showing off my xylophone, my flute, my drumset. “Isn't it neato? I can't figure out which I'm best at. I'm guessing it's the stuff that my parents yell at me less for. Heehee!”\r\n\r\n    “Your... Your parents yell at you?” Moondancer murmurs.\r\n\r\n    “Pffttt! Only when I make too much noise. But, y'know, they got me these! So they must have wanted me to make some noise! Heehee!”\r\n\r\n    “Heh... Heeheehee...” Moondancer laughs until she's red in the face. “I guess I never thought of that...”\r\n\r\n    “I bet you'd be good at the trumpet!”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, I'm good at the trumpet alright,” she says as an evil smirk crosses her lips, “after I've eaten a whole bunch of Mexicanter fried beans!”\r\n\r\n    “Ah!” I shriek, bouncing away from her and hiding behind a stuffed animal. “Moondancer! How unladylike!”\r\n\r\n    She giggles and bounces toward me, waving her horn around. “En guarde, magical musician!”\r\n\r\n    “Oh no!” I feign horror and trot around the far lengths of my bedroom. “She's an evil unicorn witch come to steal my super special talent! Help! Help!”\r\n\r\n    “Hehehe!” She giggles and chases me for a while.\r\n\r\n    I'm still running in circles until I realize that I'm the only filly giggling. I stop and turn, panting. I see her staring at a wall full of pictures taken of me and my mom and dad. I trot over, smiling. “Moondancer? What is it?”\r\n\r\n    Her smile is gone. Well, no, it's there, but it's a different kind of smile. She sniffles, but it doesn't look like she's crying. “Your... your house...”\r\n\r\n    “What about it?”\r\n    \r\n    She gulps. “It's really warm,” she says.\r\n\r\n    I blink at her. A rumble of thunder echoes outside the window, and I shudder under the refracted light of rain water. “Well... Well of course it is, Moondancer!” I grin nervously. “Why wouldn't it be?”\r\n\r\n    She stares into the shadows briefly, her eyes fluttering. Suddenly, just as quickly as she had stopped, she turns and charges at me, horn-first while grinning. “En guarde! Arrrrgh!”\r\n\r\n    “Ack! Heehee! No fair! You cheated! Cheating cheater!”\r\n\r\n    “Am not!”\r\n\r\n    “Are too!”\r\n\r\n    “Am not!”\r\n\r\n    “Are too!”\r\n\r\n    “Am not—”[/color][/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    My eyes fluttered open. I shot up with a sharp breath, staring at the lonely lengths of my cabin. The fireplace had long died out. Al was lying asleep, curled up at my side, his soft orange body rising and falling. The world was black outside, but the faintest hint of dawn was creeping over the distant, forested horizon.\r\n\r\n    It wasn't until the waves of cold assaulted my figure that I was finally brought back to the cursed present. I rubbed my forelimbs over each other, my teeth chattering. I realized it was a long time since warmth was anything but an illusion in my life. Lethargically, I gazed down at a book lying open before me, speaking endless drivel of forgotten Canterlot songs into the dim air of the cabin.\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh... The first day I'm no longer cursed, I'm taking the longest nap in recorded history.” I muttered as I daintily climbed over Al and crawled out of bed. “Because it will be recorded, dang it!”\r\n\r\n    With a brief hiss, I slithered into my stone-gray hoodie. Feeling comfortable enough, I reached for my lyre, slid it into my saddlebag, and strapped the thing to my shoulders. I made for the exit, but not without pausing. With a groan, I turned around and marched back towards the golden body of the Nightbringer.\r\n\r\n    “If I have the literal song of the Cosmic Matriarch in my possession, I might as well exercise her responsibilities.”\r\n\r\n    Al gave no response to my muttering voice. He slept soundly as I went through my new habitual task. I wrapped the priceless instrument in a pouch of regal velvet that I had Rarity produce for me at the cost of an entire bag of bits. Then, after rolling up a round carpet, I telekinetically pulled at a latch, opening the floor of the cabin to a rectangular enclosure I had carved out of the floor with magic the week before. Gently, I lowered the shrouded Nightbringer within, closed the trap door, and rolled the rug back over it.\r\n\r\n    Finally, I was ready. Marching towards the cabin exit, I shifted the weight of my lyre across my back and pointed at Al. “Don't you get any thieving ideas, ya little scamp.”\r\n\r\n    The tabby yawned, rolled over, and purred towards the ceiling. With a creak of the front door I was gone, marching out to greet the coming dawn with my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The brightness of morning accompanied my labored thoughts. Autumn was in full effect, and I could feel it in my bones. The arrival of October chased the residual heat of summer away. The dew on the blades of grass bending beneath me was positively freezing. In truth, I wasn't looking to feel comfortable. I needed to exercise the restless energy of my mind, and every jolt and chill of the autumnal morning assisted me in such a venture.\r\n\r\n    The nature of my curse would make me a regular insomniac, somepony would think. The fact of the matter is I hadn't had trouble sleeping until just recently. Having unlocked the structure of the ninth elegy, I had every reason to feel proud of myself: as if I had made some priceless progress in my pursuit of freedom. Things couldn't be further from the truth.\r\n\r\n    I was at an impasse. The ninth elegy turned out to be a duet, and there was only one [color=purple]soul[/color] in the history of everything that was eligible to carry me musically into the final, redeeming instrumental of the [i]Nocturne[/i].\r\n\r\n    How did I come to realize this? Twilight Sparkle knew nothing of “[i]Dawn's Advent[/i].” None of [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color]'s journals described the true nature of the song. Nowhere in the entire archives of Ponyville library did I find a single listing of that title. As an experiment, I had several ponies perform “[i]Desolation's Duet[/i]” along with me, including Applejack with her fiddle and Pinkie Pie with her accordion. Nothing worked to get me any closer to my goal, and I was starting to understand why.\r\n\r\n    The purpose of the “[i]Nocturne of the Firmaments[/i]” was to seal an [color=purple]alicorn goddess[/color] away from the rest of reality. Who but the [color=purple]alicorn herself[/color] could possibly have been a better candidate to usher such a lonely prisoner through [color=purple]her unsung[/color] realm and back into the dimension of the living?\r\n\r\n    I couldn't stop thinking about the spherical structure within which [color=purple]her[/color] spirit was housed. When I first entered the realm—when it was up to [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color] to save my amnesiac self—[color=purple]she[/color] had approached me from up high, summoning [color=purple]her[/color] bolts of diabolical energy, as if I was any other lost soul flung into [color=purple]her[/color] domain. On the second visit, when I played the [i]Threnody[/i] with a protection shield and entered [color=purple]her[/color] realm lucidly, [color=purple]she[/color] had approached me in person. I must have been an anomaly to [color=purple]her[/color], having visited for a second time to grace [color=purple]her[/color] plane. Perhaps that was the first time [color=purple]she[/color] saw me as a threat, and for that reason [color=purple]she[/color] had to tell me to my face that I needed to sing [color=purple]her[/color] song and become nothing.\r\n\r\n    But now that I've returned, now that I have the Nightbringer, now that I am strong and virtually untouchable in [color=purple]her[/color] domain, [color=purple]she[/color] keeps herself at a distance. [color=purple]She[/color] purposefully avoids coming into close contact with me. Do I frighten [color=purple]her[/color]? Does the fact that I know [color=purple]her[/color] secret and still walk this globe give [color=purple]her[/color] a sense of unease? What could one unicorn mortal have in [color=purple]her[/color] possession that could intimidate an undead [color=purple]alicorn[/color] lost unto time? Is it all the Nightbringer? Or is it something else?\r\n\r\n    This is why I can't sleep. I don't know what's worse, knowing that I was helpless from the beginning, or knowing that I've made so much progress only to become twice as helpless as when I first started. There was a time when playing music relaxed me. I've been trying to remember that, to incorporate that back into my life. These days, all I find myself doing is playing the one tune that has brought me more joy and ease than any other tune in the grand history of my existence.\r\n\r\n    “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i]:” I played it over and over again from where I sat on the edge of a meadow beside a long brown path. I was close to the west edge of Ponyville. The sun was just then coming over the horizon. The birds sounded across the treetops, and their chirps got lost in the gentle melodies wafting off from my vibrating strings.\r\n\r\n    I tried to imagine, if even for a brief moment, that I was just like any other pony living in that town. It must be a delightful feeling: to not be a ghost, to not have to worry about disappearing, to know that there're voices left on this earth that will say your name out loud. I don't even want to be popular. I don't even care if I have no more than five, four, or even two friends. I want my name to be spoken, whispered, laughed, sung, and even grumbled.\r\n\r\n    With a deep breath, I closed my eyes and played the song at a slower tempo, allowing my heart to beat in between each plucked string, as if I was playing the fated duet with myself.\r\n\r\n    It seems a bitter twist of irony that out of all the instrumentals of the Nocturne, the most important tune is the only one I absolutely can't perform alone. After all, the tough part isn't performing the song. The challenge is to get [color=purple]her[/color] to agree to doing it with me. But how does one appeal to a timeless spirit imprisoned by oblivion? Who am I? I'm no goddess. I'm no—\r\n\r\n    “Oh, my! A lyre! That's such beautiful music! Are... Are you from Canterlot?”\r\n\r\n    I fluttered my eyes open. Before me stood several bright blurs in the dawn light: a ruby coat, a fuchsia mane, and eyes of forest emerald. A smile broke out that could illuminate the dew-laden world twice over.\r\n\r\n    “Oh please, oh please tell me you're from Canterlot!”\r\n\r\n    “I... might be,” I stammered under a breath of confusion. Clearing my throat, I nevertheless sat up from under the tree and smiled her way. “Miss Cheerilee, I presume.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh! I knew it!” She hopped in place, nearly dropping a saddlebag full of graded papers. “You came after all! And they claimed that you were too sick to show up this week! Oh, I was so afraid of letting the students down!”\r\n\r\n    “I... uh...” I chuckled nervously and stood up, shaking the morning moisture off my mane. “I-I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.” Gulping, I leaned forward with a suspicious breath. “Were... Were you [i]expecting[/i] me?”\r\n\r\n    Before she answered, I already knew that it was too good to be true. “You... You are from Canterlot, aren't you?” Cheerilee was nervously biting her lip. It was devastating to see the enthusiasm draining from her face. I've enjoyed several conversations with Ponyville's resident schoolteacher, and it's hard to come across another pony in all of Equestria who contains that much joy and yet so little annoyance. “Oh dear, I hope I haven't jumped to conclusions. You see, I've been in constant communication with Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, and Professor Blue Noise of the Music Department was hoping to assist me in setting up a music program for the little foals of Ponyville.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey! Professor Blue Noise!” I grinned wide. “I know him! He taught me in my senior year—uhm...” I winced, already realizing that my excitement had forced me to say too much. “What I mean is—”\r\n\r\n    “So you're the one he sent?” Cheerilee beamed, nearly leaning off her hooves. “He had promised that one of his best pupils would arrive to give my students a dissertation on musical history, but the last letter said that you had fallen terribly ill and had to make a stop at Trottingham to recuperate. I figured that I would have to change this week's study topic back to basic geometry yet again.”\r\n\r\n    “Heh. Yes, well, math is math, I guess.” I gulped, feeling my insides curling up, and not in the good way. It isn't often that I fall into these bizarre niches of happenstance. But when they do happen, they're hardly anything but awkward occasions. “Miss Cheerilee, I do happen to have quite a bit of musical expertise. But I fear that there's been a horrible misunderstanding...”\r\n\r\n    “Oh?” She tilted her head aside, blinking innocently. I was intrigued at how naïve an instructor of foals could be. I suppose the world can never be too innocent. My heart went out to her, especially as she murmured, “You're... not the pupil of Professor Blue Noise after all? The one sent from Canterlot?”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I am from Canterlot, but...” I winced at myself. What was I doing? I shouldn't have even been tempting the notion. Somewhere, someplace, some poor sap from my home town was coughing his or her lungs out and the last thing I should have been doing was contemplating taking the pony's place. Just because I was a ghost didn't give me license to play with false identity, but...\r\n\r\n    What else would I have been doing that morning? Sitting down? Moping? Philosophizing? True, if I tried to pass myself off as a history teacher to a bunch of Ponyvillean children, it would hardly have made a difference. They'd completely forget everything I told them by the time they got home. I would have essentially robbed Cheerilee and her classroom of an entire day's worth of studying far more important and permanent things. So what if I could have possibly informed, enlightened, and even brought a few smiles to a bunch of foals for one day and one day only?\r\n\r\n    But, then I realized: the moment I skip out on any opportunity—no matter how insignificant—to bring happiness to other ponies' lives, then that means I would have given in to my curse. I would have let the likes of [color=purple]her[/color] win. And I don't care how many bleak circumstances I have to deal with in my pariah state; I'm not here in this town to watch the world crumble into misery. If I have a chance to spread sunshine, for even just a blink, then—darn it—sign me up.\r\n\r\n    However impulsive the notion, it made me smile, and I found myself standing up to look at Cheerilee eye to eye. “You know what? There's no point in hiding it anymore. Professor Blue Noise promised to have those kids learn a thing or two, and who am I to let a silly case of the sniffles stop me from making that dream come true?”\r\n\r\n    “You... You mean you're up for it?” Cheerilee held back her smile as her cheeks burned upon the precipice of ecstasy. “You're not too ill after all?”\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath, sucking the autumnal crispness of early October in through my nostrils and exhaling it out through a wide grin. “That's the thing about this town. Just one morning walk can clear the body [i]and[/i] the spirits. You know what I mean?”\r\n\r\n    “Heeheehee! And how!” If Cheerilee suddenly sprouted pegasus wings and floated around me, I wouldn't have been too shocked. “Oh, the kids are absolutely going to love this! I've been prepping them on basic Equestrian music theory for a week! Any knowledge you have to share concerning the pre-modern royal ballads would be absolutely stellar!”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, well...” I ran a hoof through my mane before trotting down the morning-lit path alongside her. “I might know one or two... heh...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “And the charade didn't stop until I finally got a chance to pull her foster mother, Milky White aside and tell her about the whole issue,” Cheerilee said as we strode up to the schoolyard in the early morning light. The sounds of giggling children and pattering hooves lit our ears. “The three of us had a sit-down together, and the little darling got several things off her chest. Ever since then, Scootaloo's been a great deal more well-adjusted, and she’s started forming close friendships with the other children. Why, she and two other foals are practically inseparable now!”\r\n\r\n    “Wow...” I shook my head in awe and smiled her way. “I can't imagine how stressful that must have been. You mean you actually let the little pegasus convince the entire class that you were her older sister?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmhmmm.” Cheerilee nodded with a smile. “For a little while, at least. I later explained it off as Scootaloo practicing for a local play and needing my help for acting lessons. Our 'sisters' charade was a fabrication of a fabrication, if you think about it. Heehee! The little dear is dead-set on performing on stage when she grows up, after all. In the end, I was able to give the filly a chance to exercise her emotional needs without suffering the ridicule of peers who wouldn't understand what she'd been through before moving here.”\r\n\r\n    “Whew! It's a good thing I'm just a guest speaker for the day,” I said with a nervous chuckle. “I guess I never really imagined what teachers like you must deal with on a regular basis. But, seriously, that was a genius move on your part. Ever thought of getting into psychiatry on the side, Miss Cheerilee?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh ho ho ho, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color],” Cheerilee uttered with a giggle and a wave of her hoof. “Please, you flatter me! Besides, I have too much of an affinity for gardening as it is.”\r\n\r\n    “Why does that not surprise me?” I replied with a smirk as we came upon the yard. “Whoah, hello there...” I froze in place, blinking at a big red sight.\r\n\r\n    A familiar stallion paced to a stop in the middle of the schoolyard, having given several giggling fillies and colts a bareback ride. Upon seeing Cheerilee, Big Mac smiled and lowered to his knees, letting the various foals descend onto the lawn, upon which they proceeded to scamper up to Miss Cheerilee and dance in gay little circles around the teacher.\r\n\r\n    “Good morning, Miss Cheerilee!”\r\n\r\n    “Big Mac gave us a ride around the school building!”\r\n\r\n    “I wanna be as big and strong as him someday!”\r\n\r\n    “Oh yeah? My big brother is even larger than he is!”\r\n\r\n    “Hey! T'ain't true! Big Mac is the biggest and strongest there ever was!”\r\n\r\n    “Nuh uh, Apple Bloom!”\r\n\r\n    “Yuh huh!”\r\n\r\n    “Nuh uh!”\r\n\r\n    “Yuh huh!”\r\n\r\n    “Children! Children!” Cheerilee knelt down and parted Apple Bloom from a colt giving her a raspberry. “It's true. Big Macintosh is strong and dependable, but you think he got that way by spending all his time bickering and fighting with other ponies his age? Not at all! He spent his foalhood exercising and working hard to get to where he is now! Now why don't you take his example and be nice to one another, because if you waste all your time with frowning, how will you be there for little foals when you're as old as he is?”\r\n\r\n    “You're riiiiiight, Miss Cheerilee. Apple Bloom, I'm sorry for being mean.”\r\n\r\n    “Heehee! It's okay, Spring Gaze! I ain't mad at ya! You're not mad at him either, are ya, Big Mac?”\r\n\r\n    “Nope,” the stallion said with a definitive shake of his head.\r\n\r\n    The children giggled, then gazed up at me. Several of them gasped, and soon I found a veritable train swarming around me as if I was a Hearth's Warming tree.\r\n\r\n    “Oooh! Oooh! A musician!”\r\n\r\n    “Look at her cutie mark!”\r\n\r\n    “Are you from Canterlot?”\r\n\r\n    “Are we gonna learn about old songs and stuff?”\r\n\r\n    “Do all unicorns from the Princess' city wear clothes like that?”\r\n\r\n    “I...” I fiddled where I stood, biting my lip. “I seem to have gotten celebrity status already... eheheh...”\r\n\r\n    “Students, this is Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color],” Cheerilee said to the fillies and colts gathered around us. Half of the schoolyard's crowd had formed a thick cluster of eager, bright, blinking faces. It was like a living lake of adorableness. I tried not to develop cavities from the sheer sight of it. “And you're right! She's here to teach us a thing or two about the history of Equestrian musical development! I'd say we're in for a treat, so say hello to our special guest!”\r\n\r\n    “[b]Hello. Miss. [color=green]Heartstriiiiiings.[/color][/b]” The chant was positively electric.\r\n\r\n    “Heh...” I waved back, feeling butterflies in my stomach. The cold tendrils of my curse were continents away all of the sudden. “Back at ya, kiddies.”\r\n\r\n    In the meantime, Cheerilee was turning to smile at Big Mac. “Thank you so much, Macintosh, for playing chaperone for me this morning. I had to stop by the post office along the way here; you have no idea how much of a blessing this was to me. By the way, did you restock the firewood in the back?”\r\n\r\n    “Eeyup.”\r\n\r\n    “Wonderful!” Cheerilee beamed, her cheeks red again; I wondered if she had a condition. “That will come in handy during the winter to come. I can't thank your family enough.”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, I've... uh... only been in this town for a little while,” I said with a smirk aimed Big Mac's way. “And I already get the feeling that Ponyville wouldn't survive long without the shoulders of the Apple family to lean on.”\r\n\r\n    “Eeee-nope,” Big Mac said with a teeth-glinting smirk.\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee giggled again. “Well, you can go on your merry way, Macintosh. I know you have a great deal of farmwork to do. Alright, students! Just ten minutes until class begins! Then Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color] and I will be—” She turned and gazed across the schoolyard, and instantly her smile waned. “Oh, heaven help me, not again,” she muttered with a rolling of her eyes.\r\n\r\n    I blinked curiously at that. But then I heard a squealing voice, followed by two grunting laughs. Turning, I looked over at the swing set to see two young unicorns on either side of a familiar, gray pegasus. The petite, winged colt was bouncing up and down, trying desperately to grab a ball being bounced out of his reach between the two bullies.\r\n\r\n    “I mean it, guys! Give it back!” Rumble squeaked. He seemed no bigger than the day I saved him and Morning Dew from an imploding hotel building. His cheeks were red as he huffed, puffed, and blurred his wings in desperation for the lift that could help him grab the ball from his peers. “This isn't funny!”\r\n\r\n    “I dunno, I can't stop chuckling!” A stout young unicorn rasped. His rough turquoise coat clashed with a scraggy orange mane and thick brown eyebrows as he headbutted the ball over Rumble's head and towards his lanky partner. “Heheheh—What about you, Snails?”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, Snips! Hahahah!” A ridiculously tall colt with a tan coat and lime green mane hair guffawed as he balanced the ball on several limbs and passed it back to Snips. “This is funnier than that one time you called Rumble a ‘penguin’ and he cried ‘cuz penguins smell!”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, you remember that time, Rumble?” Snips snickered and spun the ball on the tip of his horn. “Which was funnier? That or this? Heheheh!”\r\n\r\n    “I don't care!” Rumble stomped his hooves and pouted. “Just give it back!”\r\n\r\n    “Why do you want this stupid ball so much anyway?” Snips grunted.\r\n\r\n    “It's not my ball! Now give it back!” Rumble said, shifting nervously. It was then that I spotted a silky white filly crouched shyly behind a sandbox a few trots away.\r\n\r\n    “Uhm... It's okay, Rumble,” Sweetie Belle said, her cheeks red and her eyes moist. “I don't want it back that badly...”\r\n\r\n    “But it isn't [i]fair[/i]!” Rumble growled. “They should give it back!”\r\n\r\n    “Awwww! What a knight in shining armor!” Snips hissed forth a raspy laugh as he dribbled the ball between his forelimbs. “Is this your wedding gift for when you marry her? Huh? Heheh...”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhhhhh...” Rumble backtrotted, red as a beet. He looked over his shoulder; Sweetie Belle was hiding her identically inflamed face. “Uhhhhh... uhhhh...”\r\n\r\n    “Heheheh...” Snails rolled his eyes, grinning loosely. “It's funny because they both look like marshmallows!”\r\n\r\n    “[b]We do not[/b]!” Rumble and Sweetie Belle simultaneously chirped.\r\n\r\n    “Pfft! If you want to give her the ball so badly, here!” Snips gave the thing a vicious buck. “Catch!”\r\n\r\n    The sphere bounced roughly off Rumble's pale forehead. “Ow!”\r\n\r\n    “Hahahahah!” Snips and Snails leaned into each other, cackling wildly. Just then, the shadow of Cheerilee hovered over them. They looked up and instantly paled. “Aw snap.”\r\n\r\n    “Snips! Snails!” Cheerilee's eyes were hard enough to cut glass, and they burrowed their way into the colts' guilty brows. “When will you leave Rumble alone already?! What has he ever done to you?”\r\n\r\n    “Hey! We were j-just playing a little game!” Snips said. After a beat, he bumped Snails in the side.\r\n\r\n    “Ohhhh! Uhhhhh...” Snails' mouth hung open. Before he could drool, he instead managed, “Yeah! We were playing 'bounce the ball!'”\r\n\r\n    Snips looked Rumble's way. It came across as a vicious glare. “Isn't that right, Rumble?”\r\n\r\n    Rumble shyly dug his hoof into the ground while Sweetie Belle murmured something under her breath.\r\n\r\n    “Don't try fooling me!” Cheerilee exclaimed, frowning even harder than before. “This is the second time this week I've had to stop you from giving other classmates a hard time! Did you forget that talk that we had last month? Do I need to speak to your parents again?”\r\n\r\n    “Our parents?” Snails blinked, as if the concept was new to him.\r\n\r\n    Snips, however, was suddenly lucid. All traces of a mischievous frown left his body as he cleared his throat and shook his head. “No, Miss Cheerilee, ma'am. You don't have to talk to our parents or nothin'.”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhhh... Yeah!” Snails nodded, osmotically following his companion's example. “We'll be good!”\r\n\r\n    “You'd better! We have a guest speaker from Canterlot here today, and I expect you two to be on your best behavior. Now sit on the bench here for the rest of pre-school recess! I don't want to see you on the playground for the rest of the morning!”\r\n\r\n    “Awwwwwwwwww...”\r\n\r\n    “Don't give me that tone! You're lucky I don't have you cleaning the blackboard again! One of these days, I'm finally going to teach you two some manners!” She turned and trotted past me, heading straight for the school building. “I do love my job,” she said in a low voice, winking with a subtle smile. “But it helps to be firm every once and a while.”\r\n\r\n    “Heh, yeah...” I nodded and gave the two sullen colts a lasting glance before staying in close proximity to the schoolteacher. “I'd hate to see 'soft.'”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “And that's how the Great General Chucolt single-hoofedly defended the entire city of Old Trottingham from an army of one hundred thousand Lunar Imperialists without brandishing a single weapon!” I said with a smile at the culmination of the tale. “Unless—heheh—you count a [i]lute[/i] as a weapon.”\r\n\r\n    The entire classroom full of bright eyes cooed in wonderment.\r\n\r\n    “Any questions?” I asked from where I squatted on a stool with my lyre.\r\n\r\n    A filly raised her forelimb.\r\n\r\n    “Yes. You with the glasses.”\r\n\r\n    “That wath tho thpetacular! Did the General of the Tholar Monarchy actually thcare off an entire army with a thingle thong?”\r\n\r\n    I did my best to not collapse into giggles. Darn, if she wasn't the cutest thing alive. “Ahem. Yes, Miss...” I glanced Cheerilee's way.\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee winked from her desk and mouthed a name.\r\n\r\n    “Miss Twist!” I said, smiling in the filly's direction. “You see, Chucolt was a famous strategist, a master of his craft. The leader of the Lunar army had battled with him on several occasions. So, when Chucolt found himself and his meager allotment of forces surrounded in Trottingham, he resorted to using history's most infamous bluff to save the entire population he was sent there to defend. In a way, you can say it was all a matter of his reputation...” I managed a wink. “But I still chalk it up to the power of music.”\r\n\r\n    “Oooh! Ooooh!” Sweetie Belle raised her hoof wildly.\r\n\r\n    “Yes, you, with the lavender mane.”\r\n\r\n    Sweetie Belle blushed and squirmed her front hooves together as she shyly asked, “Wh-what song did Chucolt play when the enemy came into Trottingham?”\r\n\r\n    “Why, funny you should ask that. He chose a folk tune from the sarosians who used to live in the Shadow District of Canterlot.”\r\n\r\n    “Sarosians?” Sweetie Belle made a face.\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee spoke up, “They are a race of nocturnal ponies, predominantly pegasi, with leather wings and powers of echolocation: meaning they can hear things very easily in the dark so that they can fly around at night. They served as Princess Luna's royal night guard before the Civil War with Nightmare Moon began a thousand years ago.”\r\n\r\n    “Plus,” I said with a warm chuckle. “They have the most adorable ears.”\r\n\r\n    The classroom laughed lightly, all except for a pair of groaning colts.\r\n\r\n    “Could you play us the tune?” Silver Spoon asked. “Erm... if that's okay, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color].”\r\n\r\n    “Why, I would love to!” I said with a smile and levitated the lyre in front of me. “Forgive me if I'm a little bit rusty...”\r\n\r\n    The children sat on the edges of their seats. I closed my eyes, summoned the tune from memory, and played it as gently and calmly as I could. Ancient sarosian tunes, as it so happens, are typically fast in tempo and a little grating to most ponies' ears. After all, it was made to be listened to by the likes of [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color] and his fellow kin. Still, I think I managed to produce a tranquil interpretation of it. I marveled at how easy it was for me to translate the tune from the deep past of university study.\r\n\r\n    I don't know if it was the act of performing the [i]Requiem[/i] so much each passing day, or if my constant use of the Nightbringer had heightened my senses, but I felt like my musical skill had increased exponentially in the span of a few weeks. I was no longer just any amateur musician; I was a unicorn blessed with the physically manifested song of the Cosmic Matriarch, and there I was sharing such enhanced gifts with a bunch of children. It felt... right, in a way, as if I was doing something I was meant to do.\r\n\r\n    When the tune ended, half of the group looked hypnotized, and the other half looked ready to bounce out of their desks. Like good little foals, though, they waited for Cheerilee's own outburst:\r\n\r\n    “Now wasn't that spectacular? Let's give Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color] a round of applause for such a wonderful rendition of an old classic!”\r\n\r\n    The children cheered and clapped their hooves together. I smiled warmly, hugging the lyre to my chest. Perhaps all of this adulation and learning would only last for a few minutes, or a few hours at most, but somehow it didn't matter. I was feeling a piece of what I was struggling for: recognition. One of these days—I promised myself—I would volunteer to teach ponies like these and they would remember me forever, so that these smiles could resurface on their faces. One of these days...\r\n\r\n    Around that time, an excited Rumble spoke up, “That was very pretty! I liked it!”\r\n\r\n    “Pfft!” The voice of Snips grunted. “Of course you'd like it, ya fruitcake.”\r\n\r\n    “Hahahah!” Snails slapped his desktop and chuckled. “He called him a cake of fruit!”\r\n\r\n    “Why don't you serenade Sweetie Belle with that, casaneighva! Hahah!”\r\n\r\n    Rumbles bit his lip, his ears drooping above a shy face. A unicorn filly two chairs from him was hiding her blushing cheeks.\r\n\r\n    “Snips! Snails!” Cheerilee stood up, practically growling.\r\n\r\n    “Wh-what?! Snails and I like fruit! Isn't that right, Snails—?”\r\n\r\n    “Don't play dumb! That was very rude, to both Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color] and Rumble!” Cheerilee pointed. “Snips, I expect an apology! This instant!”\r\n\r\n    “Hrmmf...” Snips folded his forelimbs, rolling his eyes to the ceiling. “Iapologizeforsayingthat,” he muttered.\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee glared. “That didn't sound very sincere.”\r\n\r\n    “What? I said I was sorry!”\r\n\r\n    “Uh huh...” Cheerilee motioned towards the far end of the classroom. “Over in the corner, Snips. Right now.”\r\n\r\n    “Awww... I hate the corner!”\r\n\r\n    “You heard me, young stallion! You've been given enough warnings today!”\r\n\r\n    “Ughhh...” He lurched limply towards a stool in the far edge of the room.\r\n\r\n    “Snails, the other corner. No dragging your hooves.”\r\n\r\n    “Weee!” The colt bounded towards the side of the classroom opposite of Snips. “I love dust!”\r\n\r\n    A few young ponies chuckled at the two colts' expense. Cheerilee sat back at her desk, rubbing a sore head with her hoof. She looked towards me and managed a weak smile. “Do continue, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]. I apologize sincerely for the interruption.”\r\n\r\n    “H-hey! Don't feel bad!” I said with a nervous grin as I looked at the two delinquents with their flanks to me. “What's a proper concert without its intermissions?”\r\n\r\n    More chuckles lit the room.\r\n\r\n    “Now...” I cleared my throat and raised the lyre higher. “Who would like to learn about the song written by Starswirl the Bearded to pacify the armada of evil sea serpents in the Age of Tempests?”\r\n\r\n    “Oooh! Oooh!”\r\n\r\n    “Tell us!”\r\n\r\n    “Yeth! Thea Therpentth are thuper awethome!”\r\n\r\n    “Heheh...” I concentrated as I strummed the strings of the lyre and prepared another melody. “Remind me: are there any small rodents in the forest directly outside? This has been known to cause stampedes...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “That was absolutely marvelous, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color],” Cheerilee said in the afternoon air of the schoolyard.\r\n\r\n    “I couldn't agree more,” I said with a breath of relief. Obviously, she was referring to the lessons I had given the youngsters. Little did she know that I was simply thankful to still be having a sane conversation with her. How many hours had I been there? I couldn't tell anymore, but I had somehow managed to spend an entire session at the school without her forgetting about me. The chill of my curse was still there, and I witnessed at least a dozen foals giving me perplexed expressions. However, their teacher hadn't lost comprehension of me, and for that I was insanely thankful. It the was best possible day I couldn't have asked for. “I just wish that they'd remember all of these lessons in the future.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh don't be so modest!” Cheerilee stifled a giggle. “You're positively unforgettable, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]. Professor Blue Noise should be proud of your talents.”\r\n\r\n    “Eh heh heh... Y-yeah,” I stammered before gulping. “Still, I kind of envy your job. Well... most of it, at least.”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, yes.” Cheerilee rolled her eyes slightly. Still, her smile came back as the two of us looked across the schoolyard. Several parents arrived in groups to walk their children home. We waved at Big Mac as he trotted off with Apple Bloom. Thunderlane flew skyward with his little brother Rumble on his back. Milky White escorted Scootaloo down the path, along with Sweetie Belle—Rarity must have been busy with some project or another that afternoon. “I do apologize for the actions of a few less-than-polite characters.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey, we've all been there,” I said in a dull tone before winking her way. “Most of us.”\r\n\r\n    “Don't tell me you were a problem filly when you were young!”\r\n\r\n    “Heh. Not exactly.” I fiddled with the sleeves of my hoodie. “But I definitely grew up with one who became a spitfire when she hit her teen years.”\r\n\r\n    “Hmmm... You make it sound like they were sweet memories.”\r\n\r\n    “A little jarring in places, but ultimately happy,” I said with a nod. “We are the sum of our parts, for better or for worse,” I added in a low tone. I thought of [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color], of [color=purple]her[/color], of all the elements—both horrifying and glorious—that had brought me to such a place of understanding and comprehension that day. “I'm learning to accept the bumps of the past for smoothing out the future.” There was still a [i]Duet[/i] to perform, one last hurdle. Was I prepared for all the challenges that entailed? “I can't be too harsh on other ponies for figuring out their own places, no matter how clumsily.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, some of us have to be stern in order to help them in the process,” Cheerilee said. She shifted on her hooves and began walking away. “If you would excuse me, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color], there's a pony I've been meaning to talk to.”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh... Sure.” I said, blinking. I watched as she approached a tall, rugged stallion. He was a unicorn, pale in complexion, with a tangled brown mane and a five o'clock shadow around his muzzle. The stallion was well built, brandishing a jackhammer for a cutie mark, and I could see the stains of sweat and dust on his forelimbs, indicative of a hard day's work. I guessed that he must have been a construction pony, or perhaps a paver of sidewalks. “Must be a blue bridle job,” I muttered to myself with a smirk. I contemplated walking over to join him when a tiny shape wandered into my cloud of thought.\r\n\r\n    “Hmmph... Dumb colt,” Snips grumbled, his eyes trained on the grassy floor of the schoolyard as he waddled in my general direction. “Go home by yourself, Snails. Try and have fun on your lonesome. See if I care.” Blindly, he bumped into my side and fell on his haunches. “Ooof! Unngh...” He rubbed his horn and squinted up at me. “Oh. Sorry about that.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey!” I remarked with a proud grin. “Looks like you're not without manners after all!”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh...” He blinked, his face blank. “Do I know you, Miss?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh. Uhm...” I fidgeted, shifting the weight of the lyre in my saddlebag. “I... I guess you don't.”\r\n\r\n    “Ah. You're not Snails' mom, are you?”\r\n\r\n    “No,” I said in a calm voice. “I assure you, I am definitely not Snails' mother.”\r\n\r\n    “Cuz he went home without telling me. Pfft. Stupid colt. His life is dull as mud without me. Heh.”\r\n\r\n    “Fascinating,” I muttered. I hesitated briefly, cleared my throat, and squinted down at him. “Could I ask you something?”\r\n\r\n    He shrugged. “Sure. I'm not afraid of strangers.”\r\n\r\n    “Cute.” I smiled gently. “Why are you so...?”\r\n\r\n    “So what?”\r\n\r\n    I just spat it out: “Why are you so mean to other kids your age?”\r\n\r\n    “Mean?”\r\n\r\n    “Y'know, calling Snails' 'stupid.' Saying that Rumble is a 'fruitcake.' Stealing Sweetie Belle's toy ball.”\r\n\r\n    “Hahaha!” Snips kicked at the ground, waving his messy orange mane. “You saw that?! Ohhhh, she was practically whimpered for that silly thing back!”\r\n\r\n    “You... enjoy being cruel?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh please.” Snips rolled his eyes, and it was then that I noticed something curious about his face. “It's their fault that they're such wusses! They could definitely learn a thing or two from me! Heheh!”\r\n\r\n    “Uh huh...” I was staring at him.\r\n\r\n    He gave me a weird face. “What are ya lookin' at?”\r\n\r\n    “How...” I leaned my gaze aside. “How did your eye end up like that?”\r\n    \r\n    “Uhhh...” The gruff exterior to the colt melted in an instant. He tilted his head in a way that's instinctual for unicorns such as ourselves. He must have thought that the shadow of his horn would hide the blue discoloration around his left eye. He was wrong. “I... I bumped into something today at recess.”\r\n\r\n    I gazed fixedly at him. Eventually, I muttered, “You don't say.”\r\n\r\n    “Hmmph...” He shrugged, picking at the grass with his hooves. “It's no big deal.”\r\n\r\n    “You sure?” I remarked softly, reaching a gentle hoof towards his skull. “It looks like it must sting—”\r\n\r\n    “I'm fine, okay?!” he suddenly snarled, batting my hoof away. His teeth showed as he squawked, “Snails is a big clumsy moron and he runs into me a lot! That's all!”\r\n\r\n    Just then, a deep voice resonated from across the schoolyard: “Snips? C'mere, son.”\r\n\r\n    Snips instantly paled. His eyes twitched and he stood tall. “Uhm... G-Gotta go,” he remarked hoarsely. He trotted off, but not without adding, “S-sorry to have bothered you, Miss.”\r\n\r\n    “It's fine,” I stammered, gazing curiously as he trotted off. The schoolyard had almost entirely emptied of students. There was nopony in his way as he shuffled limply towards the tall shadow of a stallion looming before him. After a few seconds of staring, I realized that it was the unicorn adult with whom Cheerilee trotted off to speak to a few moments ago.\r\n\r\n    The young and old ponies were too far away for me to hear them, but I could tell it wasn't a pleasant conversation that they were having, at least where Snips was concerned. The stout colt had his head bowed, at least until a stomping of his father's hoof forced the young one to look up, trembling. My eyes wandered up to the stallion's grizzled face. The unicorn was frowning. It was a very stern expression, but I couldn't help but detect something akin to a dizzied weariness to the glare in his eyes. Suddenly, his horn was glowing. I couldn't tell why at first, but then I looked down to see Snips standing up on his hindquarters.\r\n\r\n    Only... Snips wasn't [i]standing[/i]. I saw his forward limbs twitching and curling awkwardly in the air. His weight wobbled precariously on his haunches. I was shocked that he wasn't toppling over within the first ten seconds, until I saw how hard his nostrils were flaring. For a moment there, it looked as though his face was taking on a blue complexion. With a jerk, he was suddenly standing on all fours yet again, panting heavily. My eyes traveled up to see that the stallion's horn was no longer glowing. Frowning, Snips' father stomped down the path, motioning firmly for the colt to follow him. Limply, Snips obeyed.\r\n\r\n    My lips pursed. I was about to say something out loud when Cheerilee's smiling face was suddenly occupying my vision.\r\n\r\n    “Oh! Hello, Miss! Are you looking for somepony?”\r\n\r\n    “Did...” I squinted past her and pointed at the two figures trotting away. “Did you just see that?”\r\n\r\n    “Hmm?” She blinked quizzically at me. “See what, ma'am?”\r\n\r\n    “That. Just now. Between Snips and that stallion...”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee glanced over her shoulder, only barely catching a glimpse of the two figures marching off. “Huh?” She looked back towards me. “Are you a member of the Edge family?”\r\n\r\n    “Is that the stallion's surname? Cheerilee, I think that—” I froze. I looked at her.\r\n\r\n    She gave me an innocent smile. “I'm sorry. Have we met?”\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath. I gazed over at the distant curve of the path. “If you'll... uh... excuse me...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I trotted slowly, quietly through the heart of town. My hooves moved like water, following the wake of the two ponies ahead of me. With calm breaths, I trailed Snips and the older unicorn. I passed by familiar sights and sounds. I heard Rarity's airy voice as she chatted with Fluttershy. I smelled the burning embers of Spike's flaming breath. I heard music wafting out of Sugarcube Corner and tasted the scent of baked candies from Bon Bon's house.\r\n\r\n    I ignored all of these sensations of Ponyville, instead honing my vision on the father and colt ahead of me. Their march was a somber thing, like a funeral procession for a dead pony that no one knew about. They moved in a sluggish fashion, the elder swaying a little bit, grumbling indiscernible things to himself. Snips made no attempt to branch off from the path, and instead he paced like a melting glacier after the unicorn, his head bowed, his breaths even. All of the spunk and vigor of the young schoolyard bully was gone. If I didn't know better, I would have imagined the little creature incapable of smiling.\r\n\r\n    Eventually, they made it to the heart of Ponyville. A series of two-story condominiums lingered two blocks away from downtown. The gardens and lawns were colorful and well kept, all except for one. To the front door of this house, the stallion trudged. He fumbled magically with a set of keys and eventually opened the door. With a dull grunt, he turned and glared at Snips. The colt's limbs sprung into action, and he bolted out of his lethargic slump, desperate to enter the household as swiftly as possible. From a far glance, two mares could be seen inside, and they looked just as dead and unenthusiastic as Snips did that very moment. Then, everything disappeared as the stallion stomped into the house, wiped his hooves on the mat, and slammed the door shut behind him.\r\n\r\n    I was standing behind a tree on the opposite end of the street. I made sure nopony was looking before resuming my constant study of the household before me. For several minutes I sat there, looking for anything. The place was eerily still. The sun was beginning to set. With a weary breath, I finally tore my gaze from the house, turned around, and carried myself towards the north edge of town.\r\n\r\n    Then there was a rattling sound, followed by what sounded like a muffled yell.\r\n\r\n    I spun around. I looked at the house, my eyes squinting at the windows. A light remained on for the space of ten seconds, and then went out. Everything was still once again.\r\n\r\n    All I could feel was the steady thuds of my heart beating heavily. Gulping a dry lump down my throat, I hesitantly turned from the sight and headed for the cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [i][color=green]It's dark, and I'm so very thirsty. Why does it have to be so hot this time of year? This isn't Dream Valley. Canterlot is up in the mountains. Can't the Princess make things cooler? She's in charge of the sun, after all.\r\n\r\n    Ugh. Thirstyyyy.\r\n\r\n    I kick the covers off of me. Yawning, rubbing my eyes, I slide out of bed. I gently step over Moondancer's cot. After two weeks, I've gotten used to her lying in the middle of the room. I don't know how she can sleep so soundly. Every night, I'm tossing and turning, and yet she's still as a rock. Maybe she wears herself out in the daytime. She's very good at playing hide and seek. She can outrace me, and I've seen her float three feet off the ground with magic. I'd never tell her, but I'm super crazy jealous of her talents.\r\n\r\n    Anyways. Water. Water water water waterrrrr.\r\n\r\n    I open the door to my room and walk out into the dimly lit hallways of the apartment. I can't stop yawning. Why is it that as soon as I'm out of bed is when I start wanting to go back under the covers? Sleep is so weird. I haven't had any cool dreams since Moondancer showed up. Maybe that's why she's sleeping so well; she stole all the dreams. I wouldn't put it past her. Heehee. I swear, she's like a wolf in pony's clothing—uuuhh...\r\n\r\n    What's going on here?\r\n\r\n    I see a bunch of ponies in the living room. There's Mommy and Daddy. And there's Moondancer's mom. Isn't she supposed to be asleep on the couch? How can she get any shuteye with so many ponies sitting around: and just who are they? Wait, I recognize two of them. I think their names are Dusk and Stellar. They live across the street with two kids. One's an egghead who never shows her face. The other's a blue-haired colt that Moondancer always blushes upon seeing.\r\n\r\n    What are they talking about anyways?\r\n\r\n    “...just glad that I can enjoy nights without having to worry about Moondancer's safety. I can't thank you enough for everything. If only I had done something sooner.”\r\n\r\n    “Don't blame yourself, Satine. You've dealt with so much as it is.”\r\n\r\n    “What's important is that you've told the Guard the truth. They have what they need now to put Nightrot where he belongs.”\r\n\r\n    “I... I just feel so horrible. I feel like I should have reached out to him sooner.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey. Satine, look at us. Don't sympathize with him. He's been feeding you lies all this time, taking advantage of your good nature.”\r\n\r\n    “And besides, there's no helping ponies who refuse to help themselves.”\r\n\r\n    “I can't believe that it came to this. He... He was so happy when we met. So peaceful. What happened to him? I wish I could put my hoof on it, but every time I think about it... I can only remember how far I dragged Moondancer with me. Oh, sweet Celestia, what have I done?”\r\n\r\n    “Shhh. Satine, what's important is that you've let us help you now. You're safe, and so is Moondancer.”\r\n\r\n    “And now all I'm doing is taking up space in this house and... and...”\r\n\r\n    “Hey, our house is your house. We're going to see you through this. And when the Court is done analyzing the situation, we'll fight for your own property back.”\r\n\r\n    “But... But Nightrot—”\r\n\r\n    “It's your house, Satine. Yours and Moondancer's. You've earned it. Not him. Don't even doubt that for a second...”\r\n\r\n    Blearily, I blink and shuffle into the living room. “I don't get it. Is it Moondancer's birthday or something? Is she getting a new house?”\r\n\r\n    All of the adult faces swivel to face me. Mom speaks, and it's really stern. “Lyra! Lyra Heartstrings, what are you doing out of bed?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhh... I-I was thirsty...” I look nervously at all of the ponies. “Is something wrong?” I turn and look at Moondancer's mom. “Mrs. Satine? Why are you crying?”\r\n\r\n    Mommy hugs the old mare as she takes a deep breath and smiles calmly at me. “We're having a little talk, Lyra, darling. Between grownups.” She looks at Daddy. “Honey, would you...?”\r\n\r\n    Daddy is already standing up, shuffling towards me. “Come along, princess. It's not time for walking around the house.”\r\n\r\n    “But... B-But I just wanted—”\r\n\r\n    “I've got you some water right here.” He levitates a cup across the nearby kitchen, fills it, and hands it to me. As I take a sip, he kneels down in front of me and places two hooves on my shoulder. “You know that Moondancer and her mom are staying with us for a while, right?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmhmmm...” I nod. I feel nervous. My eyes are staring at the carpet.\r\n\r\n    “Well, they need our help right now. Mommy and I are doing our best to take care of Mrs. Satine. In the meantime, you keep taking care of Moondancer. Huh? Whaddya say...?”\r\n\r\n    “She's not a doll, daddy,” I say with a pout. “How am I taking care of her?”\r\n\r\n    “You're being her friend, darling.”\r\n\r\n    “But I like being her friend!”\r\n\r\n    He smiles gently. “That's what makes it so wonderful. She needs you right now, and we all know how much you like hanging out with her. Just keep being a sweet, good filly to her. Mrs. Satine is telling me how happy Moondancer is now that she's got you to share time with.”\r\n\r\n    “Really?”\r\n\r\n    “You bet, princess. Done with your water?”\r\n\r\n    “Uh huh.”\r\n\r\n    He smiles and runs a hoof through my mane. “Think you can sleep now?”\r\n\r\n    I smile softly. “Mmmhmmm...”\r\n\r\n    He leans over and kisses my forehead. “There's a good girl. You need your rest for school tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n    I frown. “We're going to learn about frogs.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, how better to avoid warts?”\r\n\r\n    “Heehee...”\r\n\r\n    He swivels me around to face my bedroom door and gives me a final pat on my head. “I'll see you in the morning.”\r\n\r\n    “Goodnight, daddy.”\r\n\r\n    “Goodnight, Lyra.”\r\n\r\n    I enter my room and close the door behind me. I trot towards my bed. I stop in my tracks, blinking.\r\n\r\n    Something is wrong.\r\n\r\n    The cot is empty. What's more, I hear a quiet sound from the far edge of the room.\r\n\r\n    Curious, I crane my head to see. It's coming from the closet. I shuffle over and slide the door open. Moondancer's inside, squatting in the middle of my stuffed animals. She's hugging herself.\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer?” I squint at her. “Are you crying?”\r\n\r\n    She says nothing. She usually isn't like this. The last time I saw her shed tears was back when she first showed up at my apartment stairwell in the rain.\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer, what's wrong?” I sit down and look at her closely. “You're my friend. You should be happy.”\r\n\r\n    She sniffles. She peeks up at me from beyond her forelimbs and murmurs. “I don't want to go away...”\r\n\r\n    “Huh?” My face scrunches up. “Go away?”\r\n\r\n    She shudders, gulps, and stammers, “They're talking about leaving, aren't they? They want Mommy and me to leave! I don't want to leave!”\r\n\r\n    I smile. “Moondancer, you aren't leaving! You're staying here even longer!”\r\n\r\n    She sniffles and squints mistily at me. “We are?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmhmmm.” I nod. “I just heard them,” I say in a hushed tone, leaning forward. “My Mom and Dad want you to stay. So do Mr. Dusk and Mrs. Stellar from across the street. You're not going anywhere.”\r\n\r\n    Moondancer nods slowly, her breath coming out in tiny little gasps.\r\n\r\n    I squirm where I sit. My eyes fall to the floor between us. “Uhm... was it a bad dream?”\r\n\r\n    She shakes her head, the tears still falling. “No,” she says.\r\n\r\n    I don't know what to say.\r\n\r\n    “But...” She sniffles again and looks at me. “If I said that it was... would you stay here with me?”\r\n\r\n    I blink. I slowly smile. “Daddy says that I'm supposed to be your friend.”\r\n\r\n    “He... He does?”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah. It's kind of funny, cuz I already like being your friend so much already.”\r\n\r\n    She giggles slightly, her face cracking a smile. “Okay...”\r\n\r\n    I look at her. I don't know why, but I feel like I've found my special talent. I slide over and hug her. I don't care if it's silly for two little fillies to be hiding in a closet. I don't want her to be alone.\r\n\r\n    “Don't worry,” I say as I nuzzle her. “You don't have to worry about bad dreams around me, Moondancer.”\r\n\r\n    She whimpers something and leans into me. Her limbs feel cold. I feel bad for her, and yet happy that she's here all the same.\r\n\r\n    “I'm glad that I met you, Lyra,” she says.\r\n\r\n    “Mmm... I'm glad that you met me too.”\r\n\r\n    And we both giggle. Her sobs eventually stop. One of us falls asleep before the other. I can't tell who.[/i][/color]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I sat on the edge of my cot, restless, petting Al's purring body as he lay curled in my lap. His fur was the only source of warmth in a grand ocean of cold. I took a deep breath and gazed up out the windows. The morning sun was rising again. Another October night, and I had barely slept a wink.\r\n\r\n    With a deep breath, I stared at the contents of the cabin. I looked at the mountains of books pilfered from Ponyville Library. I glanced at the dozens upon dozens of tomes still left for me to read and peruse in my endless quest of pursuing a duet with the [color=purple]unsung[/color] goddess. I turned and gazed at the golden brilliance of the Nightbringer, a little piece of Creation standing within the confines of my mortal abode.\r\n\r\n    There were so many roads to freedom, all of them twisting and turning crazily into one another, forming a labyrinth of frigid madness and desperation. Half of the time, I wonder what's the biggest thing to solve: the problem that brought me there, or the problems that only a ghost like me is capable of seeing in the first place.\r\n\r\n    With a deep sigh, I moved Al to the center of the cot, stood up, and reached for my hoodie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We have a special guest for you today, students!” Cheerilee beamed as she paced before the classroom of gawking, blinking foals. “As it turns out, our speaker from Canterlot showed up after all! I know you've all been eager to learn about Equestrian music history! So give a warm welcome to Professor Blue Noise's prized student, Miss [color=green]Lyra Heartstrings[/color]!”\r\n\r\n    The crowd of youths politely applauded and stomped their hooves as I took center stage and sat on the stool. “Well, hello there. Feels like only yesterday that I was sharing my knowledge with an eager group of youngsters just like yourselves! And believe you me... heheh... it only gets more and more special every time.”\r\n\r\n    “What is that?” Diamond Tiara asked, squinting at my golden instrument.\r\n\r\n    “This...” I said while levitating it for all to see. “Is a lyre. It's one of the oldest instruments in Equestrian civilization. In fact, many scholars believe that the holy Nightbringer itself was likenened unto a lyre or a harp.” I smiled Cheerilee's way.\r\n\r\n    The teacher winked and spoke to the class, “Remember our lesson on the Creation Tale two weeks ago?”\r\n\r\n    The foals murmured and nodded in understanding.\r\n\r\n    “The world began with a song,” I said, breathing evenly as I presented a variation of the previous day's lecture. “Because of that, whenever we sing, or express ourselves musically, we are—in essence—getting in touch with Creation itself. It's not enough to acknowledge the rhythm of our heartbeats. No, my little ponies.” I smiled. “There are songs older than time, for they define the ages; they define us. What's more, we discover the lost parts of ourselves as we explore the creative spaces available to equine expression. It's worked for Equestrian culture over the grand course of history—as I shall demonstrate to you—and it can very well work for our futures. Each and every one of you has a fantastic destiny to fulfill, and I would like to show you how to get in touch with it. Like everything, it starts in the past...”\r\n\r\n    “Heh...” Snips grumbled as he leaned his chin against a bored hoof. “History through music. This will be as thrilling as watching paint dry.”\r\n\r\n    “Hahahah!” Snails laughed, as did a few other students.\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee frowned. She looked ready to stand up and snap at Snips—\r\n\r\n    “Well, why don't you share with us your favorite kind of music, Snips!” I interjected. “Surely it can't all be boring!”\r\n\r\n    He blinked, as if caught in an enormous spotlight. “You... You know my name?”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee was squinting at me. “You know his name?”\r\n\r\n    I merely chuckled and continued, “Don't be shy, Snips. Tell us all your favorite kind of music. You might not think it's relevant, but I'll show you that it is.”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh...” He fidgeted slightly, tapping his hooves at the end of his desk. “I... I always liked Pony Punk, I guess...”\r\n\r\n    A couple of ponies cheered. Scootaloo smirked. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon rolled their eyes. Sweetie Belle merely blinked.\r\n\r\n    “Hmmm... Pony Punk... Pony Punk...” I tongued the inside of my cheek, thinking hard. “Ah! I think I know something close to it!” I cracked my limbs, flexed my telekinetic “muscle,” and strummed the lyre with golden flashes of energy. The air filled with heavy thrashing, melodic and chaotic all at once. Several ponies' jaws dropped, the most dramatic of which was Snips'.\r\n\r\n    When the swift, psychotic, and altogether vicious tune was over, I sat back on my stool in a slump, as if trying to catch my breath.\r\n\r\n    “Whew! And I thought I was out of practice!”\r\n\r\n    “That...” Scootaloo stammered. “I-I had no idea you could do that with a harp...”\r\n\r\n    “Lyre!” Apple Bloom corrected with a hiss.\r\n\r\n    “Whatever.”\r\n\r\n    “Well... uhm...” Cheerilee shuffled nervously at her desk. “That was certainly the... uhm... most interesting rendition of the Griffon National Anthem I've ever heard...”\r\n\r\n    “Way to go!” I grinned at Cheerilee and nodded. “It most certainly was the Griffon National Anthem, albeit it's not the type you'll likely hear at the next Equestrian Olympics. Heheh...” I turned and grinned at the crowd. “You see, there's been a counter culture movement in the Griffon Kingdom as of late. With shifting power structures between the old religious oligarchy and the new democratic union, several younger generations of griffons have sought an outlet to express themselves. Thus, they took many classical songs and turned them into harsh, passionate renditions with fast tempo and heavy percussion. Thus began ‘punk,’ a griffon invention. This movement has been very popular over the last thirty years or so, and its influence has spread to Equestria where several famous artists have developed...” I smiled. “'Pony punk,' which is a slight variation” I turned to look at Snips. “I assume you've heard of Filly Talent?”\r\n\r\n    Several colts snickered and nodded among themselves. Snips, his jaw still agape, produced a bright smile. “Heheheh. Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of them.”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee looked at the class, at me, and at the class again.\r\n\r\n    I smiled, leaning back. “Now, go back in time to several hundreds of years ago, and there were similar movements in Equestria at the time of the great civil war between the Lunar Empire and the Celestial Monarchy. Granted, they didn't produce something like 'Pony Punk,' but the symphonies born from such turbulent periods were considered fresh and shocking for their time. How would you like to learn some of these tunes? It'll be like time travel! Imagine if a few centuries from now, ponies decide to perform 'Pony Punk?' Wouldn't they be getting in touch with our generation? Music is very much a part of us, you see. It's a part of who we are, who we've been, and who we will be. As we explore songs, we explore ourselves. How can it be anything but fun?”\r\n\r\n    Several of the ponies were on the edge of their seats at this moment. Many murmured with excitement. Others squirmed in anticipation. All the while, I had Snips' avid attention.\r\n\r\n    And he had mine.\r\n\r\n    “Well, for starters...” I licked my hoof and strummed a few melodic strings of the lyre. “Let's learn a little something about a stallion from olden times named Voltrot...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I stood on the edge of the playground, a few feet away from Cheerilee. I was strumming on my lyre while the foals ran in circles, enjoying the warm noon sun as recess occupied the middle of the October day.\r\n\r\n    “Slow down, Twist!” Cheerilee called out from where she was grading papers at a picnic table. “Remember how you sprained your ankle last month! You promised your parents you'd take it easy on the jungle gym!”\r\n\r\n    A lisping voice acknowledged Cheerilee's warning, and the giggles from the playground doubled.\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee smiled, scribbled a few marks on a sheet with red pen, and looked my way. “I can't thank you enough for showing up this morning, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]. I had expected a simple review of musical history, but today you had the entire classroom riveted. You should take up teaching more often!”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, well...” I murmured in mid-strum. “I guess you could say I had some practice for today's lesson.” I winked her way. “Expect nothing less from one of Professor Blue Noise's own, huh?”\r\n\r\n    “Heehee! Absolutely!” Cheerilee crossed her forelimbs and smiled. “The Equestrian education system could use more ponies with your ability to approach the foals' level of thinking and expression.” She bore a bashful grin as she graded another sheet. “I've always been told that I carry the permanent personality of a young filly. I figured it was my special talent's way of allowing me to relate with those who are blooming in the discovery of life, learning, and everything in between. I find that happiness is just as infectious as knowledge.”\r\n\r\n    “Heh... Yeah. I think I get it.” I plucked a few more strings and glanced at her. “That reminds me. About the foals here...”\r\n\r\n    “Yes?”\r\n\r\n    “I've been meaning to ask you something—” My voice lingered as I blinked at a sight waddling up towards us. “Oh. Hello there, Snips. How can I help you?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh... Hi there, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color], ma'am.”\r\n\r\n    I blinked, smiling curiously. “You remember my name?”\r\n\r\n    “But of course he does!” Cheerilee remarked, giving him an appreciative wink. “He knows a thing or two about being polite. Ahem. Isn't that right, Snips?”\r\n\r\n    “Er... Yes. Yes, ma'am.”\r\n\r\n    I glanced at the playground. Snails was on the far side of the schoolyard, playing a game of four-square with Scootaloo, Rumble, and Featherweight. It occurred to me that Snips must have not left my proximity for the last two hours at least. Something must have been distracting him. In a way, it felt like part of my “mission” had been accomplished.\r\n\r\n    “Is there something on your mind, young sir?” I asked, using the pretentious “Canterlot voice” with which I had addressed the schoolroom for most of the day's lecture.\r\n\r\n    “The way you played Pony Punk earlier on that lyre thingamajig was really awesome!” Snips said with a joyful hop. “I never expected to hear that at school! Much less in Ponyville at all!”\r\n\r\n    “Heh, yes, well...” Cheerilee interjected with a playful wink. “Don't get used to it, Snips. You can listen to that at home, but from now on, expect to hear classical music or easy listening tapes at best. I don't think the Ponyville Education Headmaster would appreciate heavy griffon thrashing on a regular basis.”\r\n\r\n    “I...” Snips bit his lip and dug a hoof through the grass. “I don't think I'll ever hear any of that at home...”\r\n\r\n    I stared carefully at him. The bruise around his eye had mostly faded. This time, I couldn't help but notice what looked to be a nasty bump on his skull, just to the left of his scraggy orange mane. Ignoring the heavy spike in my heartbeat, I asked, “Does your family not like music, Snips?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmm... I wouldn't know.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh?” I remarked.\r\n\r\n    “Nah...” He shook his head, his eyes gazing with a blank expression towards the woods bordering the schoolyard.\r\n\r\n    I tilted my head to the side. “You trotted all the way here just to say 'Nah?’” I took a deep breath. “Snips, is there something you would like to tell us?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhm...” He squirmed slightly. His head lifted up. “Y-yeah. Sure...”\r\n\r\n    My ears twitched. “What is it, young sir?”\r\n\r\n    He blinked, then smiled. “That's some really pretty music you're playing, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color].”\r\n\r\n    My spirit plummeted and rejoiced all at once. With a gentle sigh I grinned his way and nodded. “I'm a major fan of it myself. I play it all the time when I can. Would you like to give it a listen?”\r\n\r\n    “Uh. Sure.”\r\n\r\n    “It's not Pony Punk, though...”\r\n\r\n    “Heheheh,” he chuckled and sat on his portly haunches. “I don't mind! I'd like to hear it.”\r\n\r\n    “Very well then. Here goes...” I played the tune in full. It had a delightful melody, sweet and lulling and altogether devoid of sharp tempo shifts. There was a melancholic tone to the ballad, but the passionate edge in the plucked strings made the entire piece undeniably triumphant. When I finished, even Cheerilee was wowed. I heard her hooves clapping lightly at the picnic table beside me.\r\n\r\n    “Bravo! Bravo!” She managed a sight chuckle. “That was absolutely splendid. May I ask what it's called?”\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath and said, “[i]'[color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color].[/i]' And it's a tune that is near and dear to my heart. Whenever I feel down, or whenever my life is at a confusing crossroads, I know I can play this song and make everything feel all right again.”\r\n\r\n    “It certainly is...” Snips murmured, his eyes blinking as if they were receding downhill from the two adults above him. “...relaxing.”\r\n\r\n    I looked calmly at him, my hooves gently gripping the lyre. “Do you feel as though your life could use more relaxation, Snips?”\r\n\r\n    His nostrils flared. With a brief creasing of his brow, he stood up straight and mumbled, “Nah. I just...” He shuddered and turned to leave. “I was just bored, I guess...”\r\n\r\n    “It helps me when I'm bored too,” I said. I watched as Snips froze in place. I continued, “Or when I'm sad, or dull, or tired. It doesn't matter what words I use to describe it. All I know is: music makes me feel better. It's a part of who we all are, just like I said earlier today. And if there's one immortal truth to ponies, Snips, it's that we all deserve to be happy. We shouldn't let anypony tell us different, no matter how big or important they might seem in our lives.”\r\n\r\n    Slowly, he turned around. He looked up at me with a vulnerable expression. “You... You really think so?”\r\n\r\n    I nodded. “I know so.”\r\n\r\n    He seemed ready to say something, but his jaw clenched tight at the last second. He fidgeted, stuck between staying and going. After a few seconds went by, we both heard Cheerilee's happy voice:\r\n\r\n    “You've been a very polite young colt today, Snips,” she said. “I didn't have to stop you from bothering Rumble or any of the other ponies. Not even once! I'm proud of you.”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhhh...” He smiled nervously, his stubby little tail flicking. “Okay.”\r\n\r\n    “Keep it up, and I'm sure your parents will be proud of you too.”\r\n\r\n    His smile waned, but he gave us a calm nod regardless. “Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thanks for the song, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color].”\r\n\r\n    “Don't mention it.”\r\n\r\n    Snips trotted off. A slight chill filled the air, and I shuddered to think that I might never get a chance to reach that vulnerable side of him ever again.\r\n\r\n    “I wasn't just blowing hot air, you know,” Cheerilee said.\r\n\r\n    “Oh, perish the thought!” I smirked.\r\n\r\n    “He's been quite the hoof-full since he transferred here,” she continued. “His heart is brimming with excitement and yearning and curiosity, and yet it's prone to mischief and trouble-making all the same. Snips can be endearing when he wants to be, but more often than not the colt is a little sadist, and I'm constantly having to keep him and his buddy Snails in check, or else they might hurt the feelings of the schoolfillies around them or even worse.”\r\n\r\n    “Seems like there're always bad apples in a bushel,” I muttered.\r\n\r\n    “It presents a challenge, for sure,” Cheerilee said with a nod. “But I won't let these youths go sour so long as I'm watching over them. I just wish Snips wouldn't pick on Rumble so much. Snails doesn't know any better; he just thinks it's a big game.”\r\n\r\n    “You suppose Snips thinks it's a big game too?” I said, looking towards her. “As in... a way to distract himself from things he'd rather not think about?”\r\n\r\n    “How do you mean?”\r\n\r\n    “Well...” I took a deep breath, looking towards where the stout unicorn had walked off. “I can't be the only one who's noticed somewhat... [i]glaring[/i] injuries on his person.”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee nodded. “He and Snails live quite the rough and tumble lifestyle, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color].”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, no doubt.” I looked at her. “Colts will be colts. But what if it's more?”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee took a deep breath, and for once her smile was lacking. “You mean to suppose that there's another reason for the occasional bruise he shows up to class with?”\r\n\r\n    “Wouldn't you think as much?” I asked. “I mean, I'm not around kids as often as you are. But the little dude's rough around the edges. He picks on other classmates. He gets all shy when he tries to express the tiniest of sincere emotions about music.” I leaned towards her and asked in a quiet voice, “What if things aren't so peaceful around his home? Maybe the reason he doesn't get along with other students is that he can't form a connection with his folks?”\r\n\r\n    “I'd be lying if I said I didn't think that myself,” Cheerilee said in a calm voice. “But teachers twice my age with well established careers have had their jobs stripped from them for acting on such assumptions, only to be completely incorrect.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh. Well. Uhm...” I blushed, fidgeting where I stood. “Yeesh. That's gotta be a tough call to make.”\r\n\r\n    “I care for all of my students, from the bottom of my heart,” Cheerilee said. “Taking care of so many of them at once is indeed quite the juggling act. It's easy to read too much in between the lines,” she remarked. This was followed by a nervous gulp. “Or too little...”\r\n\r\n    “You know anything about Snips' parents?”\r\n\r\n    “I've met his father on a few occasions.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh yeah?” I looked towards her, my ears twitching. “What's he like?”\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Straight Edge is his name,” Cheerilee remarked. “He works in construction around Ponyville. He's a model citizen, if you ask me.”\r\n\r\n    “Does that come with a model personality?”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee chewed on the corner of her mouth. I stared at her patiently.\r\n\r\n    She sighed and gave me a tired smile. “There's a reason why I went into teaching and not into psychiatry, besides the fact that a cutie mark of smiling, blooming flowers goes horribly with ink blots. Eheheh...”\r\n\r\n    “I think you're a decent enough judge of character. What's your opinion of him?”\r\n\r\n    “He's worked all his life doing rough, menial labor,” she said. “And, as a result, he strikes me as a simple, rough stallion who's more equipped for dealing with machinery than with anything else.”\r\n\r\n    “And how does he deal with the fact that his own son is quite often a delinquent in school?” I asked, thinking about the little “meeting” Cheerilee had with the stallion the previous day. “Surely you've talked to him about it?”\r\n\r\n    “He... deals as calmly and dispassionately as most stallions do with such information,” Cheerilee said.\r\n\r\n    “And Snips' mother?” I asked. “Or does she never show up for any parent-teacher conferences?”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee slowly shook her head. “No. I can't say that I've ever had the grace of seeing her since the family first showed up in town.”\r\n\r\n    “Don't you find that a little strange?”\r\n\r\n    “Heheh... What intrigues me, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color],” Cheerilee remarked, “Is your avid interest in the matter. Is there something you know that I don't? Because, by all means, if there's a chance to get in better touch with Snips' parents, I would be happy to do so.”\r\n\r\n    “Actually...” I put my lyre away in my saddlebag and turned to look directly at her. I was hoping that a moment like this would present itself. As a matter of fact, an entire day's worth of planning was about to go into the next few seconds. “It's funny that you should ask that. When Professor Blue Noise sent me here to be a guest speaker, I decided to stay with the distant cousin of a friend of mine. She owns a condominium bordering downtown Ponyville.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, I'm quite familiar with the district.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I've had the hardest time sleeping since I came here.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes...” I took a deep breath. “I could have sworn I heard noises. Like...” My eyes traced the edges of their sockets as I recalled the sound from Snips' family household the previous day. “Like muffled shouts through the walls. I've lived in apartments before, Miss Cheerilee. I think I know the telltale sign of domestic troubles when I hear it. Well, when I left the condominium this morning, I saw a colt marching out of the dwelling beside where I had stayed.” I simply looked at her.\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee slowly nodded. “No wonder you've endeavored to reach out to Snips. That must have weighed heavily on you all day.”\r\n\r\n    “I believe things are anything but peaceful at his home,” I said. For once, it was the honest-to-Celestia truth. “I'm... not quite sure what to do about it.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, in all fairness, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color], I'm not sure there's anything that can be done about it either.”\r\n\r\n    My heart sank. “You really feel that way?”\r\n\r\n    “It's not about feeling so much as it is about thinking...” She folded shut her notebook full of half-graded papers. “We have to keep in mind that any terrible supposition is unsubstantiated unless provided with a modicum of decent evidence.”\r\n\r\n    I winced visibly. “Yeah. And I'm the last unicorn who would want to endanger your job here at the school...”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, absolutely. I would never suspect you of anything. However...” She gave what appeared to be a mischievous smile. “What a terrible teacher I would be if I allowed a piece of my students' personal property go to waste without doing anything about it!”\r\n\r\n    I blinked awkwardly upon hearing that. “Uhhh... What?”\r\n\r\n    “Why...” Cheerilee put on a mock gasp. “Snips' umbrella! The poor little fellow forgot to take it home! What a good deed it would be to personally bring it by his family's household so that it won't get devoured by moths in its neglect!”\r\n\r\n    “But, he didn't bring an umbrella at all with him this morning! There's not even a cloud in the sky! It—” I froze in mid-speech, blinking. “Wait...” I turned and squinted at her. “Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee replied with an innocent smile. “Tell me, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color], are you in a hurry to get back to Canterlot this afternoon?”\r\n\r\n    I looked at her, then grinned. “I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere, ever.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee rang the doorbell to the Straight Edge family household. A dog barked two condos down. Birds chirped and flapped about in the reddening sunlight above.\r\n\r\n    “I've done this two or three times before,” Cheerilee murmured aside, balancing the umbrella in her saddlebag. “I used to teach in Fillydelphia, you see.”\r\n\r\n    “Were there a lot of troubled households in Fillydelphia?” I asked her just as quietly.\r\n\r\n    She merely looked at me.\r\n\r\n    “Oh. Heh. Right. 'City of Brotherly Shove,'” I said with a slight chuckle. “How stupid of me.”\r\n\r\n    “Shhh. Somepony's coming.”\r\n\r\n    I nodded and let Cheerilee take the spotlight.\r\n\r\n    There was a fumbling noise from just beyond the door. Soon, the entrance opened, and my heart stopped at the sight of a tall, pale unicorn with a brown mane and even browner stubble. His eyes squinted at us with a cold, bored expression.\r\n\r\n    “Oh, hello there, Mr. Straight Edge!” Cheerilee said... cheerfully. “I do apologize for bothering you, but I think your son Snips left his umbrella at the school today!”\r\n\r\n    “Hmmm... You don't say...” Straight Edge mumbled, his dull eyes flitting towards me. “Who's this?”\r\n\r\n    I fumbled for words, feeling the urge to shiver... and not from the cold.\r\n\r\n    Thankfully, Cheerilee spoke up for the two of us. “Oh, this is Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]. She visited from Canterlot today to give the students a speech on music history. Snips seemed very pleased to learn about the topic, and he even asked a few exciting questions that the entire class was happy to have answered. Heheheh—But I digress. The umbrella.” She raised it before the stallion's grasp. “I'd hate for it to collect dust at the classroom.”\r\n\r\n    “Mrmmfff...” He telekinetically snatched it from her grasp and levitated it around before his eyes. “Can't say I've ever seen it before.” His tone was dull, unmelodious, like a ringing of metal against metal. “You sure it doesn't belong to another one of your students?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh. Oh dear... I could have sworn he brought it to school this morning.” Cheerilee smiled and gave an awkward laugh. “I've been grading so many papers lately, I could very well have been mistaken! Heheh...”\r\n\r\n    “Hmmph. No harm, no foul,” he muttered.\r\n\r\n    “Exactly! Your house was on my way home from the school building, and I thought I'd return the item just in case.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, thank you for the thought, Miss Cheerilee.” He gave the umbrella back. “But I'm afraid it's not ours—”\r\n\r\n    “My, you do have such a lovely home!” Cheerilee said. “Has anypony told you that?”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge glanced lethargically at the sparse garden flanking the prettier ones of the neighbors. “Really?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, it's such a tranquil side of town. I almost wished I lived here instead of the edge of Ponyville. I’m sure you and your family have some amazing stories to tell,” she said, laying the charm and friendliness extra thick. She smiled his way. “Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever had a chance to sit down with you and Mrs. Edge for a personal conference between parents and teacher.”\r\n\r\n    “Why...?” His eyes narrowed like dagger tips. “Has Snips been acting up again?”\r\n\r\n    I bit my lip and looked Cheerilee's way.\r\n\r\n    She was already smiling and saying, “As a matter of fact, he's been on his best behavior as of late! If you allow me, I'd gladly fill you in on it!”\r\n\r\n    He stared at Cheerilee, then at me, then at Cheerilee again. “Hmmph...” His nostrils flared. “Sure, why not?” His voice was neither angry nor optimistic; he snorted like he was marching through a cloud of fumes. Pivoting, Straight Edge marched into the household. The two of us didn't realize it was an invitation until we heard his bass voice shouting through the atrium ahead, “Autumn! Snips! Windsong! We've got company!”\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee trotted ahead. I followed her, hesitant at first. I telekinetically closed the door behind me, becoming engulfed in the scents of the household. The air was sour and unpleasant. I couldn't tell if that was the condominium being rank or just my forlorn imagination telling me that it was supposed to smell bad. I always feel a certain disconnect from myself when I walk into a stranger's household.\r\n\r\n    Everything appeared normal as we walked into the living room. Photographs of colorful, happy ponies lined the walls. I saw a kitchen with a refrigerator full of bright, foalish sketches. The dish cabinet was fully adorned with pretty, antique saucers and silverware. If I blinked my eyes, the snapshot I'd receive would look no different from the inside of the houses that my aunt and grandmother used to own. The whole place was... normal, peaceful looking. What was I expecting from Snips' household? Was I letting my assumptions get the better of me?\r\n\r\n    For a moment, I felt fearful for Cheerilee, but she looked like she was on top of the world. She smiled and sat on a sofa across from a mare who was... suddenly there. A yellow unicorn with a long red mane sat with a folded book before her forelimbs. From the way she was parked on the furniture, I could only assume she had been sitting there for the majority of the sunlit day. She smiled and shared a few words with Cheerilee before giving me a polite nod. Her smile was as fragile as porcelain, and there was a slightly hollow look to her eyes. I felt my nervousness rising again, but I said nothing.\r\n\r\n    There was another pony in the room, a filly. The little unicorn was perhaps three or four years younger than Snips. At a glance, I wouldn't have imagined the two ponies were related. She hardly took notice of Cheerilee and myself when we walked into the room. She busied herself with a series of crayons that she was sketching along a white sheet of paper. I saw gentle, colorful strokes that illustrated houses, castles, dragons, and other fantastic Equestrian sights.\r\n\r\n    “Snips?!” Straight Edge was uttering again, louder this time. “Where are you, son?!”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, you don't have to summon him,” Cheerilee said. “I already told him how proud I was of his behavior as of late. His grades have been improving too since the school year began. Do you know that he scored the second highest in our pop quiz on paleo-Equestrian biology? He has an avid fascination with leviathans and sea serpents. I sometimes wonder if his cutie mark suggests an innate desire to dissect old fossils! Heheh!”\r\n\r\n    The mare on the sofa beside her chuckled as well. “Oh, that's such a joy to hear,” she said. “There are times when I think Snips forgets that he's earned his cutie mark.”\r\n\r\n    “Sometimes, I think he just forgets to care,” Straight Edge added.\r\n\r\n    “Mmmm...” The mare took a deep breath, fiddling with her book as her eyes fell to the sofa's hoofrest. “It's taken a bit of coaxing, but I can vouch for the fact that he's paying more attention to his studies. I imagine it hasn't been easy for him, what with my disability lately...”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, I remember hearing about that!” Cheerilee remarked with a concerned look on her face. She leaned over and placed a gentle hoof on the mare's forelimb. “Just how is your horn faring, Mrs. Autumn?”\r\n\r\n    “It aches less these days, Miss Cheerilee,” Snips' mother replied with a calm smile. “With therapy, I've managed to have less and less seizures. The doctor says I've been making a great deal of progress.”\r\n\r\n    “This ain't a medical checkup, honey,” Straight Edge uttered from the kitchen. Through my peripheral vision, I saw several containers stacked on top of one another. When I turned to look, the grizzled stallion was standing there behind the counter, staring unemotionally towards us. The containers were gone. “Miss Cheerilee is giving us her sweet time to talk about our son's learning.”\r\n\r\n    “Mmm... But of course.” Autumn swallowed and looked towards us with sleepy eyes. “I'm sorry if he's giving you more trouble—!”\r\n\r\n    “Nothing of the sort!” Cheerilee said happily. “As a matter of fact, I figured I'd drop word of how good his behavior has been as of late! On the side of scoring well on pop quizzes, he's displayed a vast improvement in civility! Why, just the other day, Miss Smith showed up to deliver some lunch for her granddaughter Apple Bloom. On the way out of the schoolbuilding, the old mare stumbled and fell. Snips was the first and only colt to walk over and help her up. I thought it was the most charming gesture I'd seen all week!”\r\n\r\n    “Ohhhhhh...” Autumn smiled gently. “That does sound awfully sweet.”\r\n\r\n    “Heh...” Straight Edge marched over towards the center of the room. “You're just making that up.”\r\n\r\n    “Hardly!” Cheerilee shook her head. “Snips is a great deal more mature than the other colts his age, he just hasn't chosen to show signs of it until recently. Would you like to hear some more?”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge merely exhaled. His wife, Autumn, leaned forward and said, “I would love to.”\r\n\r\n    As Cheerilee continued, I stood by her side, trying my best not to look nervous. I glanced up a flight of stairs to see a tiny, portly figure staring down from a thin bedroom door. As soon as my eyes reached the second floor, the coltish face disappeared. Curious, I glanced down at the filly, who I presumed to be the one named “Windsong.” The longer the conversation lasted, the tighter and tighter she curled up to the sheets of paper she was drawing on. I saw her shoulders bunching together, and I couldn't help but notice how close Straight Edge was standing to her the entire time.\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath and tried to relax. It was not my place to come to wild conclusions. After all, Cheerilee was doing more in a single breath than I could ever hope to accomplish in an entire day's worth of rambling speech. I listened as she expertly plugged little details—both accurate and exaggerated—about Snips' behavior as of late. She found tiny moments to summon a word or two from his parents, and I could see how she was structurally turning the “conference” into something akin to an unofficial interview.\r\n\r\n    What was more, with each passing minute, the portrait of the household was becoming blander and blander. Eventually, the dialogue digressed into Straight Edge's line of work, the homemaker hobbies that Mrs Autumn engaged in, the friends Windsong had been making next door, and other subjects of everyday conversation. Admittedly, I was starting to feel more at ease. However, each time I glanced up at the second floor, I could make out no sign of Snips, and a part of my heart kept beating at a tense, steady tempo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Well,” Cheerilee said as the door to the Straight Edge household closed behind us. The sun was halfway through setting, and the two of us trotted out of the yard and towards the sidewalk bordering the adjacent street. “That went awfully well, wouldn't you think?”\r\n\r\n    “I didn't realize Snips' mother was dealing with so many health issues,” I remarked dully. I was staring at my hooves as we trotted along.\r\n\r\n    “It was a detail I almost completely forgot about until I saw her again. If I recall correctly, Snips' family came to Ponyville because Nurse Redheart and several of her colleagues at the local hospital had experience in the field of leyline therapy.” She turned and smiled at me. “I don't suppose any unicorns in your family have suffered from Acute Magical Disconnect? It can be terribly troublesome to the nervous system.”\r\n\r\n    “I've... heard stories,” I murmured. “It's very painful, and it takes years to recover from.”\r\n\r\n    “And I can't think of anything more distracting than having one's mother suffering and not being able to do anything about it.” Cheerilee paused to turn and rest a hoof on my shoulder. “Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color], I greatly appreciate your initiative in bringing your concerns about Snips to me. But what I think we have here is a case of a young and growing colt feeling anguish over his mother's health. With the inability to express himself, it's not uncommon for a young male pony to exert his frustrations through senseless outlets. However, all is not lost.” She leaned back and smiled. “Mrs. Autumn, as it turns out, is getting better. And now, thanks to our little 'conference,' I think I know what to talk to Snips about the next time he acts mean to one of his fellow students.”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, I guess so...” I took a deep breath. “Still, isn't it strange that he didn't show up the entire time that we chatted with his parents? Not even once?”\r\n\r\n    “Heeheehee. Shyness shows up in the most unlikely of places, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]. Don't let Snips' rough exterior fool you. He's a darling at heart, and I think there's still hope of reaching out to him.”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah...” I nodded, smiling gently. “I guess you're right.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I have to go home and get caught up on grading,” Cheerilee said. “Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color], I can't thank you enough for all the contributions you've made today. This goes above and beyond what I requested of Professor Blue Noise.” She smiled sweetly, her eyes sparkling. “Is it possible that you might bless the school with your presence again sometime before the year's over? Perhaps you would like to chaperone for the upcoming field trip to the Canterlot Gardens!”\r\n\r\n    “Eh heh heh heh...” I chuckled nervously, avoiding her gaze. “Well...” I gulped and gave her a weak smile. “I'll definitely consider it. One thing's for certain. I will never forget what happened this day.”\r\n\r\n    “Then perhaps my students aren't the only ones who learned something,” she said with a wink, shuffling the umbrella in her saddlebag. “Have a happy evening!”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah. Sure thing.” I turned and trotted away. “You too.”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh... Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]?”\r\n\r\n    I turned and looked at her. “Yes?”\r\n\r\n    She blushed slightly, blinking in a confused manner. “Where are you off to? I thought you were staying at your friend's relative's house next door to the Edge family.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh. Uhm...” I smiled awkwardly. “I... enjoy going for walks. And Ponyville is a pleasant town for a stroll!”\r\n\r\n    “Heeheehee... Isn't it, though?” She waved and trotted off. “Toodaloo!”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah. Uh. Bye.” I waved back, limply. I took advantage of the fact that her back was to me and stood there, watching her bright figure walk away until it became one with the crimson advent of evening. A sigh escaped my lips and I looked with exasperation towards the unkempt lawn of the Edge family household.\r\n\r\n    I could only blame my analytical self. I could only blame the ponderer, the scavenger, and the pillager of forsaken songs within this weathered unicorn soul for such pathetic awkwardness. Had I changed so much over the past year that I was bound to forever see things between the lines that weren't really there to begin with? I was no schoolteacher, nor was I a psychiatrist. Cheerilee was inifnitely more qualified for both of those things than I ever could be. Who was I to assume so much about Snips without seeing it with my own naked eyes?\r\n\r\n    Colts will be colts, and cursed ponies will be cursed ponies.\r\n\r\n    With a shrug of my shoulders, I turned to trot towards my distant cabin to the north of town... when I heard a noise. It was more pronounced than the muffled shout that I thought I had heard the previous day. If I didn't know better, I could have sworn I detected something breaking.\r\n\r\n    I almost ignored it. I almost kept moving. But a part of me that was still lonesomely cognizant, the part of me that shivered from the throes of [color=purple]her unsung[/color] touch, forced my hooves to swivel around. I turned and glared at the front of the house. There was another sound, louder than the first, and this time I could have sworn I saw the windows to the front of the house shaking.\r\n\r\n    I peered down the sidewalk. Cheerilee was a distant speck. I looked towards the other end of the path. Ponies were going about their daily lives, returning home, engaged in conversation: not a single one was looking my way.\r\n\r\n    In a single breath, I strolled back towards the house, snuck past the gate, and slid up to the condominium until my ear was almost pressed up against the building face. I took a deep breath and listened. Beyond the punctuated thuds of my heart, I heard voices from within. In perfect clarity, Straight Edge's growling breath was the loudest of all:\r\n\r\n    “I had to lie through my teeth for you, boy! To think of all the slack I give you—Look at me when I'm talking to you!”\r\n\r\n    “But I don't understand! What did I—?”\r\n\r\n    “You were out stealing random crap from the ponies around town! How many times have I told you to quit snatching whatever you can get your grubby little hooves on?!”\r\n\r\n    “What?! Dad, I wasn't—”\r\n\r\n    “Don't talk back! She told me you left an umbrella at school today! We never bought you an umbrella! So how did you end up with one, huh?”\r\n\r\n    “Umbrellas?! Pfft! Who cares about umbrellas anyway—?”\r\n\r\n    Snips' voice was cut off by what could only be described as a clap of thunder. I felt a bone-chilling thump, and some female voice gasped amidst the echoes of it.\r\n\r\n    “I won't stand to have thieving ponies in my very own house!” Straight Edge's rumbling voice resumed. “We stand to lose enough as it is by moving to this stinkin' town!”\r\n\r\n    “Straight! Honey, for Celestia's sake! Can't you see he doesn't know a thing about the umbrella—?”\r\n\r\n    “And [i]you[/i]! What in the hay was that all about just now?! Nopony outside the household needs to get an earful about your sickness! Certainly not Miss Cheerilee! Next thing you know, they'll think we're begging for bits out on the street!”\r\n\r\n    “I was only making polite conversation! There's no need to take this out on our son—!”\r\n\r\n    “If he wasn't such a brat to begin with, his teacher wouldn't have to be poking her head around! And she certainly wouldn't have to pick up the slack for the crap he's stolen!”\r\n\r\n    “I didn't... nnngh... t-take nopony's umbrella—”\r\n\r\n    “Shut up and go to your room because I'm sick to death of you sassin' me.”\r\n\r\n    “I'm telling you, I didn't—[i]Ulp[/i]!”\r\n\r\n    “Something wrong with your ears, boy? Go to your room and do your homework. Nnngh! I swear to Luna! Is it enough that I work my spine off for your ungrateful hide?! Or do you wanna go back to Manehattan? Cuz I can pack up our stuff and take the whole family tonight! How long you think your mom's gonna last back in our old home town, you selfish little turd?!”\r\n\r\n    “No... I-I don't want that...”\r\n\r\n    “Huh?”\r\n\r\n    “Erm... N-no sir.”\r\n\r\n    “Now scram. All I wanted was to have a peaceful, quiet evening, but you've screwed that up... [i]again[/i]!”\r\n\r\n    All this time, there was a sobbing voice, rising in pitch and volume; that is until Straight Edge snarled once more.\r\n\r\n    “Dammit, Windsong, shut up and go back to drawing! You’re almost as bad as your worthless brother. Heck, you're already twice as brainless.”\r\n\r\n    “Straight Edge—”\r\n\r\n    “I don't wanna hear it, Autumn. Bits are thin enough without me having to pay for another one of your damn seizures. So just can it.”\r\n\r\n    The house was gravely silent, save for the tell-tale thumps of Snips' hooves limping—not walking—up the stairs to his lonely room. I could barely stand straight at that point, for I was trembling too much. Gulping, I turned, looked down the sidewalk, and scampered in the direction Cheerilee had trotted off to.\r\n\r\n    In less than two minutes, I caught up to her. “Cheerilee!” I galloped to a stop, panting. “Quick! You gotta come back!”\r\n\r\n    “Huh?” she turned around, blinking at me.\r\n\r\n    “I was right all along!” I exclaimed. “As soon as we left, there were noises coming from the house! I listened in, and—as Celestia is my witness—I heard Straight Edge shouting at his family! I think he may have even hurt—”\r\n\r\n    “I'm sorry... uhm...” Cheerilee squinted at me. “What's all this about? You know Snips' father?”\r\n\r\n    “I...” I paused, blinking stupidly. I felt the chills catching up to my sweaty body. “Yes. Yes, Snips' father. We... You just finished having a conference with him and his spouse.”\r\n\r\n    “Huh... Straight Edge... Autumn...” Cheerilee's eyes scanned the horizon. She reeled, as if dealing with a wave of dizziness. “I think I met with them when they first came to Ponyville.” She smiled thinly at me. “Why, is something the matter with them? I teach for their son at my school in the west side of town.”\r\n\r\n    I blinked at her. I groaned, running a hoof over my face. “I was there. Of course, I was there with you the whole time. That’s why. For the love of Celestia. Isn’t it enough that ponies just forget about me and me alone?”\r\n\r\n    “Huh?” She made a strange face. “I.. I-I’m afraid I don’t understand. Somepony’s forgotten you? Are you looking for somepony in Ponyville that you know?”\r\n\r\n    I chewed my lip. Shivering, I looked back towards the house. As the sun melted beneath the west horizon, a foreboding shadow loomed over the building, obscuring the dull surfaces like a worn gravestone.\r\n\r\n    “Ma'am?” Cheerilee blinked.\r\n\r\n    Without saying a word, I turned and trotted away from her... and swiftly abandoned the condominiums altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I breathed evenly, peacefully. I was in control of myself. Every inhale was calm and every exhale was precise. Clutching the Nightbringer, I tilted my head up and looked beyond the tempestuous fountains and chains of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm.\r\n\r\n    High above the metal fields of moaning prisoners, her sphere loomed. The object spun circles within itself, brimming with lightning.\r\n\r\n    I stood where I was on the rusted platform with the chaotic cosmos churning all around me. I didn't say a word. I simply played “[i]Twilight's Requiem”[/i] over and over again, staring at the levitating throne of an aloof [color=purple]goddess[/color], my eternally stubborn music [color=purple]partner[/color].\r\n\r\n    With quiet patience, I had hoped to coax [color=purple]her[/color] out of hiding. I sat there for the space of an hour, the longest time I had ever spent in the dimension beyond the firmaments. Nothing happened. [color=purple]She[/color] didn't approach me. [color=purple]Her[/color] sphere didn't even float a single inch closer.\r\n\r\n    I was the only mortal creature in eons to have entered the realm of the [color=purple]unsung[/color], and in spite of all my power and abilities and knowledge, I couldn’t do a single thing about it but sit there and soak in the annihilation. At least if I was a shackled pony, I might have had purpose there. As the tempests consumed the heavens and echoed thunder across the Firmaments, I felt like I could just as easily have been watching a picture show of a faraway, fantastical place, rather than actually being there. All the fear was gone, and so was the charisma to surpass any of it.\r\n\r\n    I exhaled a defeated breath and hung my head. Gently, I played “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i],” and departed from the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm, as if I hadn't even been there to begin with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I sat on the cot in the middle of my cabin, surrounded by books. I swear that I read the same dozen pages over and over again, and on each perusal I failed to take in a single paragraph to memory. Night lingered outside. Al was playing with a ball of string in the corner. The fireplace crackled, and its amber light glinted off the brilliant body of the Nightbringer atop a nearby end table.\r\n\r\n    After several minutes, I groaned and rubbed a hoof over my face. I had spent an hour in the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm. I had spent twice as much time pouring through ancient books on Canterlot music. Still, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the shouting tone of Straight Edge out of my head. Autumn's murmuring voice lingered along the corners of my memory. With each heartbeat, I felt the thump of Snips' landing body, and then the whimpering sounds of Windsong stabbed at my consciousness.\r\n\r\n    On top of that, I still couldn't sleep. The crazed enthusiasm that had made me visit Cheerilee's school two days in a row was fading. What lay beneath was a manic unicorn, somepony I hadn't associated with for months, when madness was something fresh and alarming instead of enlightening.\r\n\r\n    “I don't know what to do, Al,” I muttered. “I'm in the right place and the right time, but what does it matter? Even if I intervene, what impact will I have? It's the same as it was with Morning Dew, and with Twilight Sparkle and Moondancer. Heck, the only reason I ever saved Scootaloo's life was because she saved mine.” I chuckled bitterly. “It seems as if this curse has me making better use out of my uselessness...”\r\n\r\n    Al rolled over the string, paused to catch his breath, and gazed innocently my way with a flick of his tail.\r\n\r\n    “I should stop thinking so much about it,” I muttered. “I've not been to every single household in Ponyville. For all I know, horrible things happen in this town on a daily basis. I should just...” I fidgeted. “I should just focus on the goal that I have, cuz it's the only thing I have in my power to fix, so long as I get [color=purple]her[/color] to help me and... and...”\r\n\r\n    Something inside me twitched. The room felt colder, even with the embers of the fire dancing brightly just a stretch away.\r\n\r\n    I bit my lip. “It's... it's easier just to finish this damnable Nocturne. It's...” I stifled a whimper, as my insides knotted up. Shivering, I looked over towards the orange tabby on the floor. “Al, could it be possible that... th-that I'm less afraid in the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm than I am in this town? Have I grown that distant?” I gulped. “That aloof? Just like [color=purple]she[/color] is?”\r\n\r\n    Al barely moved. He didn't even purr.\r\n\r\n    My nostrils flared. I turned towards the Nightbringer once more. It was momentarily blinding to my weak eyes. “The power of a goddess in my hooves...” I murmured, frowning. “And I ran like a filly... a cowardly little filly from Snips' house.”\r\n\r\n    I sighed hard. The walls of the room started to bend and buckle. In order to not collapse, I forced my eyes shut and drifted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [i][color=green]“And then he said, 'Why, of course, Miss Moondancer, I would be more than happy to carry those bags for you!'”\r\n\r\n    I nearly choke on the glass of water. I slap the container down onto the table in the school courtyard and gaze in shock her way. “Moondancer! I don't believe it! You mean to say that—?”\r\n\r\n    “Yup!” She smiles devilishly, her pale features shining in the sunlight beneath flowing locks of red and pink mane hair. “Shining Armor carried all four suitcases for me! He was really sweaty by the time we got to my room on the fourth room of the hotel at the Equestrian Embassy!”\r\n\r\n    I squint curiously at her. “Just how 'sweaty' are we talking about?”\r\n\r\n    “Ohhhhh girl...” She fans herself with her notebook full of homework. “Not sweaty enough!”\r\n\r\n    “Ack! Moondancer!”\r\n\r\n    “Heeheehee!”\r\n\r\n    “This is... This is Twilight's older brother we're talking about!” I say, nearly shrieking. Still, I'm having a hard time containing my giggles. “For goodness sake! Isn't it enough that he agreed to act as bodyguard during your study program in the Dragonlands?! You and the other students owe him your lives!”\r\n\r\n    “Oh Lyra, sweetcakes, don't get your bridle in a tangle!” She waves a dainty hoof and shuffles through a few notes. “It was all in good fun. Besides, we were hardly in any danger. The Dragonlands is about as dramatic as a Saturday night in Trottingham, which is the least I can say about their lame excuse for an education system.” She rolls her eyes before leaning forward and smirking at me. “Besides, Twilight's 'Big Beau, Best Flank Forever' was just showing off an extraordinary amount of silly machismo. It's his first year into being a guard, and already he thinks he can flex his horn and get us unicorn schoolfillies to melt! Ha! Well, I made him deflate big time! That's for sure!”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer...” I stammer, my eyes staring wide at her. “Did you...?” I gulp dryly. “You didn't let him in the hotel room, did you?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmm... Nope.” She smiles and sips at her own glass of water. “But I sure made him wish he was.”\r\n\r\n    “Ugh. You are so evil. Twilight's gonna kill you.”\r\n\r\n    “Not if she keeps being Princess Celestia's third hemisphere, she won't.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey! She's more than just an errand pony for Her Majesty! She's being trained to be a high ranking sorceress!”\r\n\r\n    “She's ranking with something alright. Have you visited her room in the palace? Whew! Place smells like dust, old books, and backsweat! And I don't mean the sexy, Shining Armor kind! I swear, that filly's gotten nowhere with being the Princess' apprentice! She's still a sad little egghead who refuses to see sunlight!”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I still think she needs our support in everything she puts her heart and horn to,” I say. “She's been there for us in the past, Moondancer. Celestia knows her parents have as well.”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, yeah.” She places her glass down and gives me a bored glance. “So, how's plucking the proverbial string treating ya?”\r\n\r\n    I give her a smug grin. “My musical education is going well, Moondancer. How's your quest to become a teacher?”\r\n\r\n    “Eh. It's alright.”\r\n\r\n    “'Alright?'”\r\n\r\n    “Yup.”\r\n\r\n    “Since you came back from the Dragonlands, I thought you had a newer, tougher curriculum to undergo.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, you mean Advanced Unicorn Sociology?”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, that. Isn't that your minor?”\r\n\r\n    “Eh. I dunno. I'm thinking of changing it.”\r\n\r\n    “Really? What to?”\r\n\r\n    “Kiss My Flank 101.”\r\n\r\n    “Seriously...”\r\n\r\n    “I mean it,” Moondancer grumbles. “All the ponies in my class are total snobs. Cream of the crappy crop of Canterlot, if you catch my drift.”\r\n\r\n    “Have they been giving you a lot of sass?”\r\n\r\n    “Well, if they weren't a week ago, they certainly are now!” She smiles with a wag of her eyebrows. “On account that they lost all their tail hairs yesterday.”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh...” I squint curiously at her. “I... don't read you.”\r\n\r\n    “Somepony might know somepony who might know another pony who laced their luxury seats at the rear of the class with superglue.” She sips from her glass again and blushes slightly. “And that somepony might be me.”\r\n\r\n    I blink, staring at her breathlessly. “You're... You're serious?!”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I’m certainly not cinnamon!”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer!” I squawk loudly, summoning several curious glances from the ponies surrounding us in the courtyard. “How... How could you?! What is this, Magic Kindergarten?! You're nineteen, for Luna's sake! What makes you think that you can do that kind of crap and get away with it still?!”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhhh... The fact that I did get away with it and those bratty, upstart snobs are now forced to walk the halls with their bare tails between their legs?!” She giggles wildly. “They all made up a story about a bunch of diamond dogs sneaking into their dorm at night and slicing their hair off to sell to the Zebra black market in Los Pegasus!”\r\n\r\n    “Oh jeez! That... That almost makes it worth it!” I clutch a hoof to my forehead and laugh until tears line my eyes. “Ohhhh Moondancer, when will you ever learn?!”\r\n\r\n    “Hahahaha... Ohhhhh... 'Learning...’” She chuckles, her face red. “If only I could sleep half as well...”\r\n\r\n    “I dunno! Heehee! You seem to have all your charm and spunk, as usual!”\r\n\r\n    “Heheheh... Heh... But no, really...” She continues to chuckle, but her laughter has become increasingly hollow, labored even. “I've been bunking at Canterlot Heights.”\r\n\r\n    I chuckle a few more times. Catching my breath, I look at her and blink. “You... You mean the hotel?”\r\n\r\n    “I certainly don't mean the asylum, though I wouldn't mind that one bit at this point.”\r\n\r\n    “Wow. Why... uh... Why aren't you staying at home? Ever since you quit dorm life, I thought you decided to stick around the house.”\r\n\r\n    “Heheheh... Because... Heh...” Her laughter dropped off the edge of a limp smile. “Because he's back.”\r\n\r\n    I stare at her. Slowly, my face grimaces. “He...? You mean...?”\r\n\r\n    She sips calmly at her glass.\r\n\r\n    My brow furrows. I squirm nervously where I stand. “But... But that's...” I shake my head and squint at her. “He moved to Baltimare. He has a business there now.”\r\n\r\n    “That was just an excuse.” Moondancer is mumbling now. I don't know what's more alarming: the news she has just told me or how rapidly she can switch from euphoric to deadpan. “The world's full of them, Lyra. Excuses, that is. And Mom's used one of them to lasso him back out of hiding.”\r\n\r\n    “But...” I gulp and feel my forelimbs shivering. “But why?”\r\n\r\n    “Pfft... Why else?” She exhales firmly, her mouth hardening into a frown. “Cuz she's a withered old tart who doesn't know how to keep her tail down.”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer!” I hiss, looking over our shoulders at everypony around us. I lean in and speak hushedly, “How could you say that? She's your mother—!”\r\n\r\n    “She's an idiot,” Moondancer grunts. “And I'm sick and tired of idiots. The only thing is that it makes no difference if I pull a prank on her. Her life is the biggest joke there is, and I'm tired of it.” She downs the rest of her water in a single gulp and slaps the glass onto the tabletop. “So, as soon as I get a chance, I'm finding a place on my own. No more dorms, no more hotels, and certainly no more bullcrap.”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer, it... it can't be a permanent thing!” I try to sound strong. It comes out as a squeak. “Your mother—She has to be going through a phase or something! You know how it is for mares that age! I'm pretty sure she'll kick him out in a week—”\r\n\r\n    “And then what?” She chuckles, but this time it is a dry and lifeless thing, like dragging a cat's tongue across sandpaper. “She'll invite him back just a few months later, or else go crawling to Baltimare herself. It's the same old song and dance, and the music just won't get out of her dang head.” She brushes a few stray leaves off her notebook before slapping it and glaring at me. “You know what the sickest part was? I spent the entire weekend yelling my head off at her over how pathetic she is to let that jerk back into our house for the umpteenth time, and she has the gall to say that I'm being 'heartless,' that I'm being a 'bad daughter...'”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer—”\r\n\r\n    “A bad daughter?! Do you know what that heartless stallion used to do to me? Huh? Did I ever tell you about the time he made me stand outside on the balcony all night for wetting the bed, and slap me upside the head if he found out I sat down even once? The friggin' pissant would even sit down beside the window and watch me! Like he had nothing better to do...”\r\n\r\n    “I... I...”\r\n\r\n    “Or what about the night he thought I spoke back to him, and so he filled a pot full of boiling water and asked me which hoof I'd like to stick in first for being such an petulant child?! This is the same stallion my mother is choosing to respect over her own daughter. Who here wants to bet it's because he's always had one extra limb than me as long as Mom's known the both of us?!”\r\n\r\n    “Okay, Moondancer,” I mutter, stirring uncomfortably. “You made your point. You're right.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh! I'm sorry!” She stands up, gasping with ridiculous melodrama. “Is this too much for Lyra's little ears?! You can't handle your best friend venting a little steam?”\r\n\r\n    “I... I didn't say that!” I exclaim, shifty-eyed. “You know that you can always come to me...”\r\n\r\n    “Then why do you look like a changeling caught in a magical spotlight?!”\r\n\r\n    I bite my lip. I don't say anything. I can't say anything.\r\n\r\n    Apparently this is enough. Fuming, she stuffs her things into her schoolbag. “You know what? I get it. I'm ruining your precious lunch. Heh. Not like it's the first time.”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer, please...”\r\n\r\n    “What? I'm sorry, Lyra. I'm sorry that I can't make this day any more enjoyable for you. Celestia knows you can't make my week any less crappy than it already is, so don't bother planning to do anything about it, not like you were trying in the first place.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey!” I frown. “Now you're just not being fair—”\r\n\r\n    “Hah!” She flippantly laughs, grinning venomously at me from where she stands with her bag. “Now that's a tragedy! Something in my best friend's life is not fair! Next thing I know, my other friend will become the pampered satellite to a princess!” Her eyes go wide as she slaps the side of her head with a hoof. “Oh, duh! That already happened! Oh well, I mustn't weigh down your high and mighty lives with my stupid baggage! You know—the stuff I've only had to deal with all my goddess-forsaken life!”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer, don't do this,” I plead with her. “Don't make a scene. You know I've only ever been there for you.”\r\n\r\n    “Been there for me?” She frowns. “You? You've 'been there for me?'” She frowns even harder. “As if you could somehow relate? As if anything you've ever done or said ever held any kind of sincerity? What do you know, Lyra? What crap have you ever gone through? Has a single thing in your life ever gone south and made you question your very own existence? You with your 'outstanding lyrical talent' and your 'career in Canterlot music history?'”\r\n\r\n    “I... uh...”\r\n\r\n    “The fact of the matter is, you've never been there for me, Lyra. And it's laughable that you'd think as much. Your parents bailed my mom and myself out, sure. But you? Did you really think that a bunch of slumber parties and stupid trips to the city park or local doughnut shop ever truly made up for all the junk I went through? Life must be really dang simple for you if that's how you clear your conscience of all the troubled ponies you'll ever have to deal with. But, please, don't ever let me rock your perfect little world. That just wouldn't be 'fair,' now would it?”\r\n\r\n    I bite my lip, avoiding her gaze. The light around us is turning foggy, and I feel a soreness in my throat that I know would make any sort of reply a mere whimper.\r\n\r\n    She knows it too, and she scoffs at it. “Yeah, go ahead and cry,” she says. “A little bit of warning for the wise: it only works for a little bit.” She clenches her jaw and trots off on iron hooves. “And I'm sick to death of only doing things halfway, like somepony I once thought was my friend.”\r\n\r\n    She leaves. The courtyard is quiet. I hear a brief stirring of nervous ponies returning to their distant conversations and studies. It isn't until her hoofsteps are completely out of earshot that I bury my face into my hooves and allow the tears to flow.[/color][/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I heard [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color]'s strings. I heard his gentle melody, his masterful reinterpretation of the finer movements of the Nocturne. I heard every rising and falling cord that marked the song that had saved me multiple times from the depths of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm, and yet it did not solace me any longer. I knew that I was not the mare he had always meant to hear that heartfelt tune.\r\n\r\n    Still, that did not stop me from playing “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i]” over and over again, adamantly and faithfully, with hope that some sort of peace would come. Hope, after all, has been the one thing keeping me alive in this place. It was the same thing that pulled a mad pony away from the roof's edge of the town hall building. It was what made me ask for a hug from an amnesiac friend who could never remember me.\r\n\r\n    For the moment, it was what made me sit on the edge of the park on the side of town, anointed by the rays of an afternoon sun, with the crisp breeze of October circling soothingly around me as if I was just any other blessed soul. For a second, I wondered if dust would someday cover my body when I no longer had breath to give, or if even in ashes I would forever be an anomaly to the lengths of time.\r\n\r\n    I heard a pitter patter of hooves. Looking over, I saw four familiar foals. Scootaloo was drawing a red wagon, within which Apple Bloom was seated, wearing a ridiculously cute cape. She stared down a spyglass, licked her lip, and pointed adventurously towards the edge of a hill while Rumble and Sweetie Belle caught up with the pair on waddling limbs. They glanced at me as they scampered by. Then, in a second breath, they looked to my side and grimaced. With mutually blushing expressions, they hid their faces and hurried along.\r\n\r\n    I raised a curious eyebrow at that, until I heard a rasping voice beside the bench upon which I was squatting.\r\n\r\n    “That's a relaxing song.”\r\n\r\n    I turned to look; my heart skipped a beat. Awkwardly, I smiled. “Funny. I had another colt your age say the same thing the other day.”\r\n\r\n    “What?” Snips squinted up at me. “Do you perform around town? Like a traveling minstrel or something?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhmmm...”\r\n\r\n    “Cuz we once had a showpony visit Ponyville once.” His ears drooped. “That didn't turn out so well.”\r\n\r\n    “Don't your parents ever warn you about talking to strangers?” I asked, and almost immediately winced for doing so.\r\n\r\n    “Hmmph!” He raised his chin and horn and marched across the path before me in an extraordinary show of pride. “I can look after myself! I'm not a little foal, y'know! I've got a cutie mark!”\r\n\r\n    I looked at the symbol in question, but was instead distracted by a brand new limp to his gait, a limp that he tried in futility to hide. My ears twitched at the memory of the sound his body made after being tossed across the condominium. “You certainly seem like a tough little pony to me,” I remarked, trying my best to maintain an adult smile. “Since when did rough and tumble stallions trot clear across the hillside at the sound of sweet music?”\r\n\r\n    “I didn't trot across the hillside! I...” He fidgeted, gnawing on his lip. His face hung towards the dirt path. “Meh... I was just killing time.”\r\n\r\n    I looked at him, at the grassy fields, then at the bright blue sky. “Seems like such a beautiful day.” I glanced Snips' way again. “Don't ponies usually see you hanging out with another colt? Some lanky fellow?”\r\n\r\n    “Hmm? Oh, you mean Snails?” He shrugged his stout shoulders. “He's off chasing bugs or something. I dunno.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, it's a shame to be alone on an afternoon like this.” I strummed a few more notes of “[i]'[color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color].[/i]' “Why not go and see what he's up to?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmrff...” He dug at the dirt and sighed. “You ever have a day when you just don't want to see other ponies?”\r\n\r\n    I smiled a bit more genuinely. “You're seeing me, aren't you?”\r\n\r\n    “Well, you play such good music, Miss...” He looked up at me, and his eyes were bloodshot. It appeared as though I wasn't the only soul in Ponyville dealing with insomnia. “And it's not like anypony's paying you or forcing you to do it. You're just doing it because you like to, don't you? I mean, why else would you be here?”\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath, shrugging. “Silence is hardly a fitting friend.”\r\n\r\n    He chuckled lightly, then gazed at the grass bordering the path. “That must be a really cool special talent to have.”\r\n\r\n    “What? Music?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmhmm...” He nodded, flicking at the emerald blades and upsetting a few leaping aphids. “All I got on my flank is these stupid scissors. I still don't really know what they mean. So many ponies my age want to get their cutie mark badly, and I don't even know what mine's all about. Isn't that stupid?”\r\n\r\n    I lean forward, narrowing my eyes. “Don't you have ponies where you live to share these thoughts with?”\r\n\r\n    His nostrils flared and a frown crossed his face. “Nothing's gonna change the fact that I have a lame talent.” He looked up at me, and his expression was once again soft. “I don't know why, but when I hear that music, I don't feel so bad anymore. Even if it's your talent and not mine, there's something very... relaxing about it. Too bad I can't make that kind of sound with scissors. Heh...”\r\n\r\n    I looked at my lyre, running a hoof over its smooth edges. “Music is a lot more special than we give it credit for. It was part of the foundation of the world, after all. It's older than both talents and feelings combined.” I chuckled slightly and looked at him. “I really don't blame you for being drawn to it.”\r\n\r\n    “You mean I'm not bugging you?” He asked, his stubby tail flicking anxiously. “Cuz... y'know... I was just walking around and... and... Meh, I dunno...”\r\n\r\n    “Heheheh... Just relax,” I said. My lungs exhaled peacefully as I heard myself say, “A song is never meant to just be played, but to be heard.” I smiled for myself as much as for him. “I was hoping to have an audience.”\r\n\r\n    “Huh...” He sat on his haunches, wincing slightly from the fresh bruise, but nevertheless smiling. “Would you... Would you play that song one more time? Erm, that is, if you don't mind...?”\r\n\r\n    I shook my head. “I would love to.” I began strumming “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i]” once more, and already I could see Snip's eyes closing as his ears relished the soft melody. “The world we live in has many joys,” I said beneath the lulling rhythm. “We should never, ever feel guilty for wanting to be happy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I took even breaths, squinting from where I crouched behind a tree and a cluster of bushes. Just beyond the nearby length of fence, the condominium of the Straight Edge household lingered under a waning sunset. Hours after treating Snips' to as many renditions of [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color]'s song as I could, I had followed the colt from a distance while he wandered around Ponyville before eventually—hesitantly—returning to his home on the edge of downtown.\r\n\r\n    My body was tired and my eyes were dry from three nights of very little sleep. I couldn't deny a sharp tremor that was shuddering through my system. What was I doing there? Being cursed didn't give me the right to act like a stalker. My only consolation was the firm knowledge that Snips wasn't the pony I was looking for.\r\n\r\n    Finally, I saw my target: Straight Edge. The grizzled stallion was trotting home, or at least he was trying to. He swayed a bit in his step, his hooves shuffling in an inebriated pattern that I only found moderately surprising. After several minutes, he stumbled up to his front door. His shoulders heaved in an exasperate sigh, as if he had instead showed up to the worst night job imaginable. After telekinetically lifting a pair of keys up to the door, he marched into the dimly lit condominium and slammed the entrance shut behind him.\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath and gazed around me. The sun had completely set. The stars were coming out overhead. Crickets were signaling through the air in a denser and denser chorus. There was nopony around to see what I was about to do.\r\n\r\n    On stealthy limbs, I hurried towards the front lawn of the Straight Edge household. I opened the fence gate and slithered up to the entrance. Hiding my body safely from the windows, I pressed my ear up to the building front. My heart was pounding. My coat hairs were standing on end. In over a year of haunting the lengths of Ponyville, I had never done something like this. True, I had helped myself to the interior of Twilight's library on occasion, but she was my foalhood friend, and every occasion that I stumbled upon her place of research it was to acquire more important reading materials or do more study on the [i]Nocturne[/i] or play the “[i]Song of Summoning[/i].”\r\n\r\n    But this? This was trespassing in the worst possible way. The same spirit that kept me from robbing Rarity blind or stealing Rainbow Dash's thunder or taking advantage of Applejack's hospitality was slicing a dagger of guilt across my heart. I almost pulled myself away after twenty minutes of hiding there, when I finally heard what I came for.\r\n\r\n    Windsong's unmistakable sobs sounded off first. It was followed by Straight Edge shouting one horrible thing after another. Snips' voice rushed up to the sounds Windsong was making, and then Straight Edge shouted some more. For the briefest of moments, Autumn's whimpering breath tried to intervene, but Straight Edge's growling drowned her out, followed by the sounds of bottles breaking. A dog two condos away started barking.\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath, and felt a tug on my lips. I was smiling, for I now had what I needed. Swiftly, I turned away from the door front and ran like an emerald lightning bolt across Ponyville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inside the front lobby of the Ponyville Police Department, one stallion in blue finished polishing his horseshoes while murmuring across the lanternlit station. “And so I said to him, 'Sir, unless your neighbor's socks have the magical power of breaking laws of probability, I sincerely doubt they sprouted hooves, climbed out of your neighbor's hamper, and somehow made it into the drawers of your work desk across the street!'”\r\n\r\n    “Hahaha!” Another officer flipped the pages of his newspaper from where he lazily sat behind a counter. “Blessed Celestia! Is that when you arrested him?”\r\n\r\n    “Dang straight. Turns out the old pervert was stealing the lady's stockings for months.”\r\n\r\n    “This thing that old stallions have for mares' socks...” The other shrugged and sighed. “I just don't get it.”\r\n\r\n    Right then, the doors burst open. The two officers stood up abruptly and spun to look. “Uhhh... Can we help you?”\r\n\r\n    I stood, panting, and gulped. “Yes! You can help! But not me! Somepony else! There's a house in trouble on Burton Street!”\r\n\r\n    “Could you be more specific, ma'am?”\r\n\r\n    “I-I wish I could!” I exclaimed, my eyes glistening as I raised two shaking hooves up and toyed demurely with my cyan locks of mane hair. “I heard some horrible noises and yelling! I think that there might be a robbery in progress! I was walking by one of the condominiums when I heard the most terrible racket! I... I was so scared! You gotta go investigate!”\r\n\r\n    The two officers exchanged glances. With a firm nod, they bolted up, grabbed their equipment, and rushed out the door along with me. “Don't worry, madame. We're on it. Just show us the way.”\r\n\r\n    I watched them. Stifling a proud smile, I cleared my throat and broke into an anxious gallop. “Oh thank you, officers! Thank you, so very much!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Here! Right here!” I exclaimed a few minutes later, pointing shakily at the front lawn to the Straight Edge family's household. “I was walking past the sidewalk when I heard the noise!”\r\n\r\n    “Hmmm...” One officer murmured, adjusting his hat as he stepped up to the fence. “The front gate's still open...”\r\n\r\n    “Oh... Yes... Uhm...” I fidgeted and smiled nervously. “Must have been a robber!”\r\n\r\n    “We'll take care of this. Please step back.” One of them marched up to the front steps. As he did so, a few muffled shouts rattled the windows of the home. I was both terrified and jubilant all at once. “Hello?!” The officer knocked on the front door. “This is the police. Is everything alright in there?”\r\n\r\n    Again, there was a wave of noise. I instantly detected Straight Edge's growling voice. Windsong was whimpering. Or perhaps it was Snips. I no longer cared. Everything was collapsing and coming together in beautiful poetry.\r\n\r\n    “I repeat, this is the police! Please respond!” The officer put his ear against the door. He frowned. He looked back and gave the officer a firm nod.\r\n\r\n    His partner patted my shoulder. “Stay here.” He whipped out his baton and gripped it in his teeth as he galloped up to the steps.\r\n\r\n    “On three.” The other officer pivoted around, coiling his rear legs. “One... Two... [i]Three[/i]!” He bucked the doors open, snapping the hinges. His partner rushed in as he shouted, reaching for his own baton. “Everypony freeze! This is the police!” Gripping his own weapon, he rushed in after his partner.\r\n\r\n    I stood outside, squatting on my haunches, waiting. A minute went by, and all was silent inside the condominium. I took several jittery breaths, fiddling with the stone-gray sleeves of my hoodie. More minutes passed by. All I could hear was crickets.\r\n\r\n    I started to panic. Did Straight Edge do something horrible to his wife and children? Did he turn out to be too strong of a stallion for both officers to handle?\r\n\r\n    “Oh dear Celestia,” I murmured out loud as a sharp chill ran through my figure.\r\n\r\n    Could I have inadvertently traumatized Snips and his little sister? I knew that Straight Edge was asking for it, but did the colt and filly really deserve to see two grown ponies tackling their father to the floor? Could I possibly have given Autumn another seizure?\r\n\r\n    Worry turned to despair, and despair turned to action. Hesitantly, I trotted up the path and approached the door to the room. “Uhm... Officers?” I heard nothing. I looked through the dimly lit foyer, seeing the paintings and furniture and normal bric-a-brac of domestic life. “Is... Is everything okay? Okay, so I confess; there wasn't a robber after all.” I gulped and trotted deeper into the household, my breath coming out in vapors. “But you needed to see this. You needed to stop this from getting any worse—” I froze in place.\r\n\r\n    The two officers were standing casually with Straight Edge in the center of the living room, sharing glasses of lemonade. Autumn was sitting on the couch, cradling a sobbing Windsong. Snips squatted on the bottom step of the condo's stairs, staring lethargically into the carpet.\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, but the Wonderbolts are soooo out of shape this year,” one of the officers said with a smirk while swirling his glass. “On account of Fleetfoot and Mercury having gone on tour in the Griffon Lands back in spring.”\r\n\r\n    “Those darn Griffons never cut pegasi a break,” Straight Edge said in a grumbling voice. The corner of his grizzled face curved upwards. “Fleetfoot and her buddy never got to show off. They just hung around in pony hotels waiting for the Griffons to kick 'em out of the country so they can get back to real work. Shoot, I don't even know why Canterlot bothered with the exchange program to begin with.”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah! Heh... Those two beaked morons they borrowed could never fly in formation anyways! Thank Goddess they showed up after this year's Best Young Flier's Competition and not before!” One officer took a sip, turned, saw me, and nearly spat out his drink. “Koff! Koff—Auck! Ahem. Can we help you?”\r\n\r\n    “I... I...” I stood dumbly in place, squirming.\r\n\r\n    “Hrmmf...” Straight Edge's eyes were thin. “She must have seen the door from outside.”\r\n\r\n    “Nothing to be alarmed about, ma'am,” one officer said, waving at me. “An honest-to-goddess mistake on the force's part.”\r\n\r\n    “I swear, I've been on the beat for fifteen years, and I've never done anything like this!” The other said. “I promise you, Mr. Edge, the Department will pay for the damages.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey, nothing that I can't fix myself. It's good to know that you guys are always around at a moment's notice.”\r\n\r\n    “Yes...” Autumn stammered, trying to get Windsong to calm down. “It's nice having the police cl-close by...”\r\n\r\n    “That's just what I said, [i]honey[/i],” Straight Edge growled lightly.\r\n\r\n    “This... This can't be right!” I exclaimed, my lips quivering. I frowned at the officers and pointed at the walls of the room around us. “You mean you just charged in here and saw nothing going on?! I knew I heard shouting!”\r\n\r\n    “That was probably the poor foal here being scared by Ponyville's finest,” an officer said sheepishly. “Heh. If the Lieutenant doesn't chew us out for this mixup, I dunno [i]what[/i] will tip him over.”\r\n\r\n    “I don't know what got into us,” the other remarked. “I suppose it's these late night shifts, y'know? One second you're at the station, and the next you're swinging a baton around at loud noises! This town's made basket cases out of us all, what with Nightmare Moon, Ursa Minors, and [color=purple]parasprites[/color]!”\r\n\r\n    “Hey, didn't I tell you to forget about it?” Straight Edge chuckled. “If anything, you made my evening more exciting. It certainly shook me out of the damnedest stupor. I think I got the energy to get some work done around here for a few hours thanks to you guys.”\r\n\r\n    “But... But...” I blinked, then frowned, then snarled. “No!” I stomped my hoof. “This is wrong! Things aren't right with this household!”\r\n\r\n    “Excuse me?” Straight Edge glared daggers my way. I almost stumbled back from that. Almost.\r\n\r\n    “Ma'am, please...” One officer put his glass down and marched firmly towards me, his face serious. “I understand if you or any of the other neighbors may have been startled, but this has all been nothing more than a terrible misunderstanding—”\r\n\r\n    “No! You just don't know anything! You've forgotten! All of you!” I started panting. I pointed a heavy hoof towards the mare and her child. “Why are they so freaked out, huh?! Why is she still crying?”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge sighed and looked lethargically at the two police stallions. “Officers, it's really late. Could you do us a favor and...” He gestured towards me with his head.\r\n\r\n    “Ma'am, if you would come with us—”\r\n\r\n    “Snips!” I pointed at the colt. He jolted from the sound of his name. “Ask h-him! Ask him what's been going on in this household!”\r\n\r\n    “Okay, that's quite enough—”\r\n\r\n    “How'd you get that limp, Snips?!” I almost shrieked as the first officer grabbed my shoulder. I tugged away at him and pleaded with the youngster from afar. “And those bruises on your face?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmm...” He hugged himself, scraping his hooves across the carpet. “Snails... and I g-got into a fight...”\r\n\r\n    “Ungh...” Straight Edge rolled his eyes. “Darn kid...”\r\n\r\n    “Snails?” One officer made a face.\r\n\r\n    “His... Uhm...” Autumn shivered where she sat. “His friend. From school.”\r\n\r\n    I frowned. “He's lying! She is too! They're afraid! They're afraid for their safety! Can't you see that?!” As the one officer tried pulling me towards the entrance, I grunted and shouted at Snips. “You didn't have those bruises earlier when I played that music for you, Snips! How did you really get them?! Huh?!”\r\n\r\n    “I...” Snips gulped, looked at his father, and flinched. “I-I've never seen this unicorn before... Honest...”\r\n\r\n    I felt all the color leaving my sweaty face.\r\n\r\n    “I think you need to come with us down to the station,” the stallion uttered, tugging at my forelimb.\r\n\r\n    “Nnnngh!” I snarled and summoned a burst of magic. A shield of protection energy bubbled away from my horn in a green flash. The officer gasped, not even remotely expecting such a show of power. Before he could recover, I was galloping out of the household and charging into cold Ponyville night. My eyes twitched with fury, and my ears rang with the thunder of my churning heartbeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “So lemme get this straight,” Rainbow Dash squinted from where she hovered above Twilight Sparkle and Applejack in the town library the next day. “You’ve lived in this town for over a year, but nopony has ever known about it because you’ve got some mystic curse that keeps any soul from remembering a single thing about you? And instead of trying to get us to help you fix this craziness, you’re asking that we investigate some stallion beating up on his kid?\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath, stood tall, and firmly nodded. “Yes.”\r\n\r\n    Rainbow Dash pivoted and looked at her two friends. “Now can I say it?”\r\n\r\n    Applejack muttered, “Reckon ya can, sugarcube.”\r\n\r\n    Rainbow Dash spun and hissed at me, “[b]Horsefeathers[/b]!”\r\n\r\n    I sighed and rolled my eyes. I was low on sleep, strength, and sanity. It took a cosmic effort to stand upright in the midst of these mares, much less keep a sane expression.\r\n\r\n    “Of all the crazy, low-brow, lame attempts at grabbing attention!” Rainbow Dash hovered circles around me, tossing accusatory glares. Her incredulous rambling was of little comfort to my frayed nerves. “Your randomness makes Pinkie Pie look like a college professor! Oh, so you heard about the Elements of Harmony! So you heard about Twilight Sparkle, the magical apprentice to Princess Celestia, and how she and her bestest friends defeated Nightmare Moon! And now what? You just want a slice of the popularity pie! I mean, hey, kudos on subtlety! At least you're not making us go on some global quest to a 'Nocturnal Locker' on the opposite side of the world or some other epically unrealistic crud! Still, this whole Straight Edge nonsense is downright creepy! Just how long have you been sticking your nose into other ponies' business, huh?! And making nasty claims of child abuse?! Bah! This is a clean town, filly! I'm Ponyville's eye in the sky! I would know this crap!”\r\n\r\n    I turned and looked coolly at her. “And you would also know that the only reason you haven't already gone off to join the ‘awesome’ Wonderbolts and leave everything else behind is because your new and altogether ‘boring’ friends here in Ponyville have unwittingly filled a niche in your life, dissuading the biggest fear you've ever had: of being perpetually alone.”\r\n\r\n    Rainbow Dash's ruby pupils shrank as she fell flat on her haunches. “Derr... wh-what did you just say—?” She began to whimper, shivering like a foal.\r\n\r\n    Applejack was frowning. “Now see here, Missy—”\r\n\r\n    I turned towards her. “And you—whose father was the inspiration for both the physical and metaphorical foundations you constantly lay down for yourself and the ponies around you—you just can't stop staring at this hoodie that I'm wearing, can you? Perhaps it's because deep down inside, Applejack, you know that there's a reason for its familiarity; it's the same jacket you once wore when tending the orchards of your farm. You loved it because its color reminded you of your father's coat in winter when he held you close and sang you songs passed down for half a dozen generations.”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh...” Applejack's face paled as she pulled her hat off and held it to her chest. “Land's sakes...”\r\n\r\n    “And you...” I pivoted and smiled at Twilight, who flinched visibly. “A pony who fears the greatest horror of all: being forgotten. When you came to Ponyville and you saw the spark of friendship that solidified your place here forever, you discovered what it meant to cry tears of happiness for once. Beforehand, whenever you sobbed, it was always in the lonely confines of the Canterlot Castle study halls. But you never dared share your concerns and sorrows with Princess Celestia. 'After all,' you had once told me, 'Starswirl the Bearded was the greatest mortal magician who ever lived, and he died alone with nothing but his scrolls.' You used to believe that a lonely existence was a necessary means to greatness. But since you found your friends here in Ponyville, a piece of you was willing to be forgotten by the Equestrian history books, because you'd rather be happy in the now than despondent for the future.”\r\n\r\n    Twilight stared at me, her lips quivering. “I... H-how...?”\r\n\r\n    “There isn't enough time to explain 'how,'” I said, leaning forward and smiling gently. “All that matters is why. And the answer is: I want to help ponies, just like you do. Right now, we have an opportunity to do just that, but no good will come to Snips' family if we just sit around on our flanks.” I stood back and gazed at the group as a whole. “You would be completely different, completely lonely mares if you didn't take the leap of faith by becoming friends. But in doing just that, you turned into the three strongest, the three most dependable ponies in the whole of Equestria. Won't you take another leap of faith, right here, right now?”\r\n\r\n    Rainbow Dash was shivering. Twilight Sparkle sniffled. Applejack placed her hat back on her blonde head and gazed at the other two silently. They looked back at her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I don't see or hear anything,” Rainbow Dash muttered under the fall of evening.\r\n\r\n    “Shhh!” Applejack exclaimed hoarsely from where we crouched on the sidewalk outside the condominium. There was a light inside and shadows shuffled within. “Remember what Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color] said. Give it time! Apparently this Straight Edge fella gets all hotheaded at random.”\r\n\r\n    “I still think this is really weird,” Rainbow Dash remarked, frowning. “Not to mention really uncool. I mean—we're totally spying on other Ponyville ponies! In their apartments!”\r\n\r\n    “If you're afraid, then go home,” I grunted sullenly.\r\n\r\n    “[color=green]Lyra[/color],” Twilight whispered to me. “That wasn't very nice. We're taking a 'leap of faith' for you, after all.”\r\n\r\n    “I know...” I sighed and ran a hoof over my exhausted complexion. “And I'm sorry, girls. It's just... You won't believe what I've gone through to try to intervene on this family's behalf.”\r\n\r\n    “And y'all mean to suggest that neither Miss Cheerilee nor the police could help any?”\r\n\r\n    “I'm afraid not, Applejack. It's the curse, remember?”\r\n\r\n    “It's just so much to take in,” Twilight Sparkle remarked. “The search for Scootaloo, the hotel collapsing on Rumble and Morning Dew, the [color=purple]parasprite[/color] infestation: you mean to say that you were there for each of those occasions?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes,” I said, then winced. “Though... that last part would take a really, [i]really[/i] long time to explain. And even then I'm still a bit sketchy on the details...”\r\n\r\n    “I... I-I saved Scootaloo...” Rainbow Dash gulped and foalishly gazed at her two friends, her wings drooping. “Didn't I?” she almost wimpered.\r\n\r\n    “Shucks, girl,” Applejack remarked, fanning herself with her hat. “Next thing we know, y'all gonna tell us you were responsible for gettin' Wind Whistler and Caramel hitched!”\r\n\r\n    “Heh...” I grinned wickedly and doubled over. “Heh heh heh heh heh heh!”\r\n\r\n    Rainbow Dash made a face. “What's so dang funny?”\r\n\r\n    “Ohhhhhhh...” I mumbled into my hooves. “I really, [i]really[/i] need to get some sleep...”\r\n\r\n    “Twilight, darlin'.” Applejack looked at my foalhood friend. “Ya sure this spell is helpin' us blend in with the shadows all good and proper?”\r\n\r\n    “For the millionth time, yes, Applejack,” Twilight Sparkle replied. “Unless Princess Celestia herself shows up and lights up this part of the neighborhood with her horn, we're darker than a thundercloud. Nopony will see us all sitting here.”\r\n\r\n    “Good.” Applejack shivered. “Reckon it's a might rotten feelin' to be sitting here all incognito.”\r\n\r\n    “You said it, girl,” Rainbow Dash added.\r\n\r\n    Twilight Sparkle stirred nervously. She glanced over at me. “Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]?”\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh...” I tiredly gazed at the household with bloodshot eyes. “Yes, Twilight?”\r\n\r\n    “Assuming everything you've told us is completely true—”\r\n\r\n    “And it is.”\r\n\r\n    “Right. Absolutely.” She cleared her throat. “This curse sounds like an awful ordeal for any single pony to go through. Could it be possible that—between the fantastical tasks of being chased by an undead [color=purple]alicorn[/color] and trying to learn a forgotten magical symphony—you've simply [i]imagined[/i] this little detail about Snips' family?”\r\n\r\n    “I know what I've heard...”\r\n\r\n    Applejack poked in. “Heard?”\r\n\r\n    I sighed. “[i]Seen[/i] and heard. Heard and seen—Nnnggh. [i]Look[/i]! This Straight Edge stallion is bad news! And no matter how horrible my situation is, I'm not going to let a tragedy like this slip through the cracks! It just... It just isn't fair! This world...” I grimaced as memories shot through my head. In a blink, I thought I saw the misty sight of a school courtyard beyond a veil of tears. It looked too eerily similar to a rainy Canterlot street beyond a shadowed stairwell. Groaning, I rubbed my forehead with a pair of hooves.\r\n\r\n    The three mares shared nervous glances. I could already sense that I was losing whatever threadbare confidence of theirs I had earned thus far.\r\n\r\n    “Twilight...” I muttered, tilting my head back up. “You... You remember Moondancer, right? I mean... You remember what she went through?”\r\n\r\n    A sharp breath escaped from Twilight Sparkle's lips. Her violet eyes began quivering. “You... You knew Moondancer?”\r\n\r\n    I blinked, my heart beating hard. [i]Oh dear, sweet Celestia. I forgot. I always, always forget about this little part[/i].\r\n\r\n    “Uhm... Ahem.” I smiled nervously at her. “You... you told me about her. Y'know, during our past meetings...”\r\n\r\n    “And I've since forgotten...” Twilight Sparkle nodded, begrudgingly accepting that. She sighed and murmured, “Just how much did I tell you about Moondancer, exactly?”\r\n\r\n    I swallowed and said. “Enough.” I placed a gentle hoof on her shoulder. “You remember how much your parents, Dusk and Stellar, helped Moondancer and her mother Satine in their time of need?”\r\n\r\n    Twilight slowly nodded. “How could I forget? I was really young at the time, but I became close to Moondancer later.” She smiled gently and glanced towards Applejack and Rainbow Dash. “She was the one friend I had long before coming to Ponyville.” A sharp pang surged through her system. “But... all of that has changed now...”\r\n\r\n    “Do you still love her?”\r\n\r\n    Twilight flashed me a look. She blinked a few times, and her eyes became moist. “Of course I do. I... I suppose I always will, in a way...”\r\n\r\n    I smiled gently. “Could you imagine how her life would have been if she never knew you? Or if her mother never knew your parents? I mean...” I gestured while speaking. “What if Dusk and Stellar overlooked the little details, the tiny yet significant signs that things weren't very...” I lingered, gazing briefly aside at the other two mares. “Ahem... weren't very [i]happy[/i] in Moondancer's household?”\r\n\r\n    Twilight chewed on her lower lip. “I... I shudder to think...”\r\n\r\n    “Twilight,” I said, “We are not just strangers in this world, or mild acquaintances or even simple neighbors for that matter. We are all placed on this planet for a reason. I mean... we are all crafted out of the same song, molded out of the same chorus that sang Creation into being. It is our duty—no—it is our [i]nature[/i] to reach out to each other when we notice a great problem that needs to be addressed. Even the most horrible curse ever conceived by ponydom can't change the fact that we are meant to be the living salvation of each other, chasing away evil, blowing away the ashes of chaos with our righteous breaths of harmony. So, you see, helping Snips and his mother and his sister is like your parents helping Moondancer! Because... Because it's all part of the same glorious movement! Like a beautiful instrumental that knows no end...”\r\n\r\n    Twilight Sparkle stared at me. Slowly, she gave me a very gentle smile.\r\n\r\n    “You’re frickin' high,” Rainbow Dash grunted.\r\n\r\n    “Rainbow!” Applejack hissed.\r\n\r\n    “Jeez! Just listen to the lime-green fuzzhead!” Rainbow Dash whispered, gesturing wildly. “Have you ever heard a pony say so little with so many stupid words?!”\r\n\r\n    “We ain't here to be judgin' no poetry contest!”\r\n\r\n    “Ugh! I hate all this waiting around! Either let's bust some guilty, child abusin' heads or go home! Goddess almighty...”\r\n\r\n    “Shhhh!” Twilight exclaimed, raising her hoof as she tilted her gaze towards the house. “Did you hear that?”\r\n\r\n    “What? What?” I exclaimed, jittery all of the sudden.\r\n\r\n    “Give her some ear room, sugarcube,” Applejack said, resting a gentle hoof on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n    Even Rainbow Dash was leaning forward, craning an ear from where she hovered. Her eyes circled around the edges of their sockets. Suddenly, there was a sharp cry, followed by a heavy thud. Her wing feathers stood on end. “Horseapples!”\r\n\r\n    “Sounds like a hog wrasslin' contest in there,” Applejack added, her features hardening.\r\n\r\n    “If only it was,” I muttered icily. I glared at the three. “Still doubt me?”\r\n\r\n    Twilight Sparkle gulped, her body jolting as several more shouts echoed from the condominium a few steps away. “That... Is that actually Snips' father?”\r\n\r\n    “Stick a feather in my eye!” Rainbow Dash hoarsely exclaimed. “Sounds more like an angry dragon!”\r\n\r\n    “If there's somethin' I can't stand for...” Applejack grumbled angrily. “It's a self-respectin' parent tossin' his own young'ns around like bales of hay.” She adjusted her hat to add shadows to her glare and turned towards us. “Reckon we should fetch the cops?”\r\n\r\n    “Didn't you hear Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color] earlier?” Twilight retorted. “It didn't work last time!”\r\n\r\n    “Nothing good will come of this if we just repeat what I did previously,” I said, trying to keep my cool as the windows of the house rattled again and again. “What I need is for the three of you to witness this all at once—” My body was assaulted with a sudden chill. I saw vapors spreading from my muzzle. My eyes twitched. “Oh no...”\r\n\r\n    “What is it?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh no no no no no no!” I leapt into Twilight's face and all but yanked at her mane. “Who am I?!”\r\n\r\n    “[color=green]L-Lyra Heartstrings[/color]!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n    “What's goin' on—” Applejack started.\r\n\r\n    I turned towards her. “Say my name!”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh—[color=green]Lyra[/color]!”\r\n\r\n    I flashed a glare at Rainbow Dash. “And you!”\r\n\r\n    “Fuzzhead!”\r\n\r\n    “Rainbow—”\r\n\r\n    “Er, I mean [color=green]Lyra[/color]!” She shook her head wildly. “Seriously! What's the big deal—?!”\r\n\r\n    “Praise Celestia!” I moaned, then frowned. “There isn't much time! It's now or never!”\r\n\r\n    “For what?”\r\n\r\n    “No questions!” I tugged at Twilight again. “You gotta teleport us in there!”\r\n\r\n    “Wh-what?!” She flinched from me as if I had the plague. “Are you nuts?”\r\n\r\n    “Just about! I can't risk the curse undoing everything right now!”\r\n\r\n    “Everypony calm down. Let's just mosey up to the front door and do this all civil-like—”\r\n\r\n    Another cry came from the house.\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, screw that,” Rainbow Dash said. “Twi?”\r\n\r\n    “Okay, but this feels like a bad idea—” She started to concentrate, her horn glowing hot.\r\n\r\n    “Just do it!” I growled, my bloodshot eyes quivering. “Before it's too—”\r\n\r\n    There was a bright flash of lavender light. The shadow of evening dissolved in a blink, and the four of us landed in the Straight Edge household's kitchen. Glass bottles, porcelain plates, and metal silverware settled all around us. The air was sour with the smell of alcohol, and I was seeing stains on the carpet that weren't there the previous day.\r\n\r\n    “—late!” I murmured, freezing on the sight of what was before me. Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle were identically still as statues.\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge was levitating Snips in the air. There was a bright glow around the struggling colt's throat, and tears were streaming from his eyes. Autumn was draped halfway off the couch, her weak forelimbs stretching in desperation towards the struggle. In the far corner, Windsong was curled up in the corner, her eyes bright and full of trembling horror.\r\n\r\n    “—don't you ever, ever tell me what to do, boy!” Straight Edge was snarling. “I know what's best for your mother, and I don't need none of your goddess-awful attitude! I'm the one workin' my flank off for her therapy everyday! Just what in the hay have... you... ever... contributed...?” Straight Edge's eye twitched, then locked on the four trespassers. He hiccuped, swayed, and merely growled. “What in Luna's name is this crap all about—?”\r\n\r\n    Applejack was pouncing across the room like orange lightning. “You get yer dirty magic off him, ya mangy demon!” She barreled right into him, head first.\r\n\r\n    “Ooof!” The stallion fell back and crashed through an end table.\r\n\r\n    “Straight!” Autumn shrieked.\r\n\r\n    Windsong wailed.\r\n\r\n    Snips fell limply toward the ground, only for Rainbow Dash to fly over and swoop him up. “It's okay, lil guy. I gotcha!”\r\n\r\n    “What in the hay is the meaning of—?” Straight Edge gasped as a pair of heavy hooves landed on his chest. “Ooof!”\r\n\r\n    “Nopony... And I mean [i]nopony[/i] should be treatin' their own flesh and blood that way!” Applejack snarled.\r\n\r\n    “What are you doing to my husband?!” Autumn shrieked.\r\n\r\n    “Lady!” Rainbow Dash barked from where she cradled a sputtering Snips. “You're dang lucky she's not kicking his lousy teeth in!”\r\n\r\n    “Everypony, just calm down!” Twilight exclaimed. She was shivering heavily; I had never seen her this scared.\r\n\r\n    “You come into my house?!” Straight Edge struggled and shoved against Applejack's pressure. “You stick your manes into my life?! I should be calling the cops on you stupid wenches!”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, wouldn't that be a hoot!” Applejack almost spat on him. “I'd like to just [i]see[/i] you rat yerself out of [i]this[/i], ya varmint!”\r\n\r\n    “Get off my husband!”\r\n\r\n    Windsong wailed even louder.\r\n\r\n    “Auugh! Can somepony help that filly to... t-to calm...” Rainbow Dash started to teeter in mid-air.\r\n\r\n    “Rainbow?” Twilight stammered. “What's wrong?”\r\n\r\n    “Just... Just so dizzy...” Rainbow Dash muttered, almost letting Snips fall from her grasp.\r\n\r\n    I looked at her, or at least I tried to. A breath of cold vapors was blocking my sight of the pegasus. I gasped sharply, gritted my teeth, and yanked Snips from her hooves as gently as I could. “It's happening already!”\r\n\r\n    “Huh?!” Applejack looked up. “What's happening already—[i]Whoah nelly[/i]!”\r\n\r\n    “Rrgggh!” Straight Edge was shoving the mare off of him. “I swear to Tartarus, you're going to pay for this!”\r\n\r\n    Applejack stumbled back and slammed into a china cabinet. Glass shattered. The shadows of the room swayed from a lamp teetering.\r\n\r\n    “Applejack!” Twilight cried out.\r\n\r\n    I was dashing over to scoop Windsong up. I planted her on my back and spun about. “Twilight! Get us out of here!”\r\n\r\n    “But... But...” Twilight began summoning a force field as Straight Edge picked up a metal poker from the fireplace and stormed angrily towards Applejack's dizzy figure. “Everything's gone to heck—!”\r\n\r\n    “Where do you think these two kids have been living in their whole lives?!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n    “Hey!” Rainbow Dash saw Straight Edge charging Applejack with a weapon and immediately went into action. “What's the big idea?!” In a blink, she was tackling the stallion to the ground, rattling paintings off the condo's walls with the impact.\r\n\r\n    “Darn it, Twilight!” I exclaimed. “We gotta get these foals out of here! This may be our only chance—” Just as I said this, a frigid chill ran through the house. “Oh Celestia, please—”\r\n\r\n    “Nnnngh!” Twilight was already charging energy through her horn. Just as Straight Edge shouted something and swung a hoof at Rainbow, the two of us were blurring away along ethereal leylines. I clung tightly to the shivering bodies of Snips and Windsong. In less than two seconds, we stumbled to a stop against the side of a building across town. “Ooof!”\r\n\r\n    “Unngh!” Twilight rolled to a stop in the moonlit grass. She coughed and sputtered. “I... g-got as far as I could...” She winced and tried standing up. “But Applejack and Rainbow Dash—”\r\n\r\n    “They're stronger than the two of us,” I stammered, hugging the two foals close and catching my breath. “What matters is that these kids are safe.”\r\n\r\n    “Kids...?” Twilight remarked, shaking her head wearily. “I... don't understand. Applejack... Rainbow Dash...”\r\n\r\n    “Twilight, we both know they've got it covered—” I stopped, blinking at her, noticing how she was rubbing her head as if coming out of a migraine. “Wait...”\r\n\r\n    Just then, a bright light shone on all four of us. I winced and squinted towards what turned out to be the double-doors to town hall opening wide.\r\n\r\n    “My word!” The Mayor of Ponyville trotted out, gasping in shock at the sight of two unicorns and a pair of traumatized children. Several elder ponies walked out with her, squinting and studying the awkward scene. “What's going on out here? It sounded like a bomb went off!”\r\n\r\n    “We're sorry about that, Mayor,” I said. “Twilight teleported us here. You see, something horrible has been happening on Burton Street and—”\r\n\r\n    “M-Mayor!” Twilight Sparkle stood up, blinking wide. “Why are you up so late?”\r\n\r\n    “We were having a late night meeting of the City Council to discuss preparations for Nightmare Night. What, may I ask, are you doing out here in the middle of the street? It looks like you just fell from the sky.”\r\n\r\n    “I... uh... I dunno...” She looked my way, then scrunched her face at the sight of the trembling, bruised unicorn in my grasp. “Snips?! Oh my goddess! What... What happened to him?!”\r\n\r\n    “Twilight, you...” I gulped. I reached a hoof out towards her. “Please. Think carefully. I know you had to have retained something...”\r\n\r\n    “Huh?” Twilight was trotting over. She and the Mayor knelt down to examine Windsong and Snips. “Retain what? I don't understand! What happened to these foals?”\r\n\r\n    “Hey! Twilight!” Rainbow Dash's voice exclaimed.\r\n\r\n    I gasped. I spun around and looked up high.\r\n\r\n    The pegasus was flying towards us, breathless. “There you are! We need your help!”\r\n\r\n    “What is it?”\r\n\r\n    “It's Straight Edge!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n    Twilight gawked. The Mayor and her fellow council members murmured in concern. Windsong and Snips sat up, shivering in fright. A part of me deep inside was smiling...\r\n\r\n    “You won't believe it!” Rainbow Dash's voice cracked. “There's been a break-in at his house! We think somepony nabbed his kids!”\r\n\r\n    I stopped smiling immediately. “Hoboy...”\r\n\r\n    The Mayor breathlessly stammered, “Straight Edge's and Autumn's children?! Kidnapped?!”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh...” Twilight Sparkle raised an eyebrow and pointed at the two foals. “You mean these kids?”\r\n\r\n    Rainbow Dash did a double-take, her ruby eyes twitching. “What in the hay?!” As she touched down, two figures trotted up from a moonlit block over.\r\n\r\n    “Twilight! There you are! Did Rainbow tell y'all?!” Applejack was also out of breath. She brushed a blonde bang up beneath her hat and exclaimed, “Somethin' plum evil's ahoof! Rainbow Dash and I just woke up in Straight Edge's house like we came out of a spell! Next thing we knew, his kids were gone!”\r\n\r\n    “It must be some kind of sorcery,” Straight Edge remarked. “I thought you ponies defeated Nightmare Moon! For Pete's sake, my family and I moved to Ponyville to avoid this kind of nonsense! We have to tell the police or else—” The stallion froze as his eyes narrowed rigidly on the two tiny unicorns in the center of the group. “Wait a second. What in the heck is going on here?!”\r\n\r\n    “I... I-I wish I knew!” Twilight Sparkle remarked, gazing at all of the equines and trembling under the cold starlight. “Applejack? Rainbow Dash? You mean to say that you woke up in Straight Edge's house just now?”\r\n\r\n    “Reckon it was on our way home from helpin' you at the library, Twilight,” Applejack said. “Plum flummoxed if I know how we got inside his home...” She scratched her chin. “Oww... My limbs feel banged up somethin' fierce. Whatever it was that knocked me and Rainbow Dash must still be out and about!”\r\n\r\n    “Perhaps the children could shed some light on this situation,” the Mayor suggested.\r\n\r\n    “Windsong? Snips?” Straight Edge stared down at them. “You know what this is all about?”\r\n\r\n    Windsong merely whimpered. Snips was blinking dazedly, rubbing his neck with his hoof.\r\n\r\n    “Well?” Straight Edge's eyes narrowed.\r\n\r\n    “I...” Snips trembled, his lips quivering. “I... I don't know...”\r\n\r\n    “Nnnngh!” I stomped at the grass with my hooves, startling everypony. “Snips, [i]tell them[/i]! Tell them the truth! You don't have to be afraid of him!”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge cast me an awkward glare. “Who's this crazy mare?!”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh—” Twilight started.\r\n\r\n    I shouted again. “Snips, don't let him intimidate you! You're surrounded by ponies who can help you and your sister and your mother! Tell them how your father throws you around and abuses your family!”\r\n\r\n    “What...?!” Straight Edge backtrotted, his face twisting.\r\n\r\n    “The hay?!” Rainbow Dash looked crookedly at Twilight. “Twi?! Do you know this freaky unicorn?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhm... Ma'am?” Twilight gently trotted towards me. “I... I don't know who you are, but I think you should calm down—”\r\n\r\n    “Nnnngh!” I shook her off, hyperventilating. I knelt down before Snips, pleading with him. “Snips. [i]Please[/i]. Everypony deserves to be happy, especially you, especially right now! Tell them the truth!”\r\n\r\n    “I...” He wilted away from me, his eyes moistening. “I-I'm scared. I want to go home...”\r\n\r\n    My heart fell. I whimpered. “Snips. Snips please...”\r\n\r\n    “Y-You're scaring me, lady,” he whimpered, clutching his little sister tightly and shrinking away from my frenzied expression. “Please, I just want to go home...”\r\n\r\n    I almost collapsed right there. The elder ponies behind the Mayor were murmuring hushedly among themselves. I felt the shadows of Applejack and Rainbow Dash converging on me.\r\n\r\n    “Simmer down there, sally. Seems like you're a stranger around these parts, but I reckon you might be able to shed some light on this recent kidnappin'...”\r\n\r\n    “Unless...” Rainbow Dash's eyes grew narrow as she hissed suspiciously at me. “...you [i]are[/i] the kidnapper.”\r\n\r\n    I turned. I looked at Straight Edge. Perhaps it was a glint from the moon. Perhaps it was just my imagination, but I could have sworn I saw a pearly-toothed smile. “Nnnngh—!” Everything turned to hot, bright emerald. As soon as the flash was over, half of the ponies were sprawled out on the ground, including Rainbow Dash and Applejack.\r\n\r\n    I didn't bother to help them back up, for as soon as I let loose the magical discharge, I was galloping as fast as I could towards the north edge of town. The cold of my curse pelted me between each heaving breath. My hoodie was heavy with the sweat that had soaked it from my every pore.\r\n\r\n    The world flickered with a kaleidoscope of moonlight through the trees overhead. The October breeze froze my nerves. Once I was out of earshot of the downtown area, I skidded to a stop and leaned against a park bench. It was a very familiar spot, a place where a tranquil unicorn had once played the gentlest of songs for a lonesome colt.\r\n\r\n    There was no room for peace, no room for happiness, not for Snips and most certainly not for this pariah.\r\n\r\n    A low growl fluttered up my lungs, boiled through my throat, and exploded out my mouth. The world flashed emerald again. There was a crackle of thunder, like [color=purple]her[/color] furious wrath rippling across the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm, and with a weight akin to the holy Nightbringer, I unleashed a wave of unbridled magic ahead of me. The bench shattered to wooden splinters, splattering debris all across the grassy hilltop beyond.\r\n\r\n    The only thing more distressing than my wanton act of destruction was the bitter knowledge that anypony who saw it the next morning would simply explain it away with some accursed excuse or another. Shaking my head and fighting the tears, I galloped towards my cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Threnody bled into the Requiem. The strings of the Nightbringer rang shrilly, harshly, like my gnashing teeth. I lifted my head and glared into the swirling tempests. Lightning radiated all around me, but the thunder of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm wasn't enough to drown out my shouting voice.\r\n\r\n    “Come down from there!” I growled. “Come down from [color=purple]your[/color] high throne and play '[i]Desolation's Duet[/i]' with me!”\r\n\r\n    The spheres within spheres levitated, loomed, but did not descend. Bolts of lightning illuminated several moaning ponies crawling across the platform in the shadow of [color=purple]her[/color] lofty presence. Jets of water sprayed across the scene, and yet nothing changed.\r\n\r\n    “I'm not asking [color=purple]you[/color]! I'm [i]telling[/i] [color=purple]you[/color]!” I hissed and sneered into the freezing gale. “[color=purple]You[/color]'re going to come down here and help me finish the [i]Nocturne[/i] and [color=purple]you[/color]'re going to do it now! Then I'll be out of [color=purple]your[/color] life, out of [color=purple]your[/color] mane, and out of this damnable pit in the universe that [color=purple]you[/color] call a home! I know [color=purple]you[/color] don't want me around, so let's get it over with! Get [color=purple]your[/color] undead flank down here and let us kill the music together!”\r\n\r\n    A ring of lightning boiled around the sphere, coalesced into a furious branch of energy, and rocketed down towards me. I clung heavily to the Nightbringer, summoning a shield around me that deflected all of [color=purple]her[/color] wrath. The concussive blast blew the rusted platform dry, knocking moaning souls off their haunches.\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh!” I fought against the vaporous tumult, shouting over the ringing body of the Nightbringer. “I will not sing [color=purple]your[/color] song! [color=purple]You[/color] will sing mine, dammit!”\r\n\r\n    Another strobe of energy bulleted my way. I weathered the onslaught, fighting it back with my energy, grinding my hooves into the rust and grime below. As the thunder settled, I stared up, gnashing my teeth as tears ran down my face.\r\n\r\n    “I hate [color=purple]you[/color]...”\r\n\r\n    The sphere slowly, gently flew away.\r\n\r\n    “I [i]hate[/i] you!” I screamed into the chaos between firmaments. “Damn [color=purple]you[/color] and damn [color=purple]your[/color] putrid symphony! Damn [color=purple]you[/color] and [color=purple]your[/color] booming voice and [color=purple]your[/color] shattered wings and [color=purple]your[/color] cold spirit and [color=purple]your[/color] pathetic neutrality and [color=purple]your[/color] holier-than-thou aloofness! It's no wonder that the only ponies [color=purple]you[/color] have to rule over are pathetic waifs! [color=purple]You[/color]'re the queen of nothing but the heartless, thoughtless, trotting dead! Who in their right mind could ever possibly [i]love[/i] [color=purple]you[/color]?! Certainly not the Cosmic Matriarch! I think it's fitting that she dumped [color=purple]you[/color] inside this horrible toilet between dimensions! What kind of a [color=purple]goddess[/color] has so much power and so much strength and yet doesn't lift a single hoof to make the world any better?! What's so special and tragic about [color=purple]your[/color] life that [color=purple]you[/color] have to hide in here like a stubborn little foal having a tantrum in her room?!”\r\n\r\n    The sphere flew off, disappearing into the tempests, looming beyond earshot.\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless, I snarled, “[color=purple]You[/color]'re selfish! [color=purple]You[/color] hear me?! [color=purple]You[/color]'re selfish and [color=purple]you[/color]'re a coward! Maybe instead of rewriting history, [color=purple]you[/color] should think of improving the future! [color=purple]Your[/color] sisters are doing it! Why can't [color=purple]you[/color]?!” I clutched the Nightbringer to the point of breaking and spat, “All I want is to be real! To make a difference! To help ponies around me! But [color=purple]you[/color] just can't have that, can [color=purple]you[/color]?! [color=purple]You[/color] know what?! I don't care how powerful [color=purple]you[/color] think [color=purple]you[/color] are! I have the Nightbringer, [color=purple]you[/color] insufferable [color=purple]demoness[/color]! I have all of eternity to scream at [color=purple]you[/color]! And so help me, if all [color=purple]you[/color] want is for me to be a ghost, then I'm going to haunt [color=purple]you[/color] until the end of time! [color=purple]You[/color] hear me?! [color=purple]You[/color] will not have any rest in this pathetic grave [color=purple]you[/color] call a home! I won't let [color=purple]you[/color] rest! I won't let [color=purple]you[/color] rest, [color=purple]you[/color] stupid waste of song! I [i]won't let [color=purple]you[/color][/i]!”\r\n\r\n    All was madness and cold. I sat upon the brink of the drowning abyss, shivering, standing on the only source of warmth I had left.\r\n\r\n    And the source of that warmth bred a lasting scream through my lips as I tossed my hooves in frustration, grumbled, and played “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i]” on the Nightbringer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I stood before my cabin, my hooves occupying the middle of the dirt road to the north of town. I was several feet away from my patio, but I couldn't bring my limbs any closer to it. I was perfectly still; not even the lingering cold of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm made me shiver.\r\n\r\n    There was a light from behind the windows where I had left a lantern lit. I knew that somewhere inside, Al was either sleeping or inspecting his half-empty food dish, perhaps purring—wondering when I would show up again.\r\n\r\n    I couldn't see him. Not then. Not anytime soon.\r\n\r\n    With a deep breath, I turned and glanced at the morning light glowing over the edge of the horizon. I teetered briefly, remembering all of the things I had been through recently, and yet still ignoring all of the sleep I had lost over them.\r\n\r\n    My hooves shuffled. I pivoted and mutely faced the path towards Ponyville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Hmmm?” Ambrosia lifted her hard hat, wiped the sweat from her pale brow, and plopped the article back down in the afternoon light. “Straight Edge? Yeah, the feller works with me all the time; he's a good laborer. It's not often that we have a unicorn who's willin' to get his hooves dirty in our line of construction. Plus, heh, I reckon that horn of his is pretty darn useful, what with all of our machinery goin' on the fritz from time to time. T'ain't no accident that he earned himself a jackhammer for a cutie mark. Ya feel me?”\r\n\r\n    “I'm... not concerned about how he works,” I slurred, standing before her on the edge of a partially built house on the edge of town. Drills and hammers were sounding off on either side of me. I winced and tried to keep my hooves straight. “I was wondering where he goes when he's done for the day.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey, you alright, Missy?” Ambrosia asked, her green gaze narrowing. “Them eyes of yours are pretty dang bloodshot.”\r\n\r\n    “I'm [i]fine[/i],” I grunted. “If you wanna know the truth...” I gulped dryly, brushing my mane straight with an errant hoof. “I'm... I'm the stallion's neighbor, and his shouting is keeping me up at night.”\r\n\r\n    “Shoutin'? Straight Edge?” Ambrosia made a face. “Ya tryin' to say that things ain't all that peachy-keen in his household?”\r\n\r\n    “Does that surprise you?”\r\n\r\n    “Well... Heh...” Ambrosia shrugged, smiling awkwardly. “He complains a lot about his wife naggin' on him, but that's just usual talk, y'know. It's custom to make jabs at our significant others, what with how much tougher our line of work is than most ponies'. But I never thought much of it. Heck, even my coltfriend has overheard us from time to time and he's snickered quite a bit—”\r\n\r\n    “Look, can you just...” I shook my head, sighed, and murmured “Could you just tell me... uhm... where he usually goes before heading on home? Because I happen to know for a fact that he doesn't return to the condominium until evening time.”\r\n\r\n    “Well...” Ambrosia fidgeted. “There's really only one place where most hard-workin' ponies go when the sun goes down...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I stood inside the atrium of the Copper Crown Tavern that night. I'd never entered that place before. Upon smelling the interior, I realized why. The air hung with a hazy mist. In the furthest reaches of the dimly lit establishment, ponies coughed, muttered unintelligible words, and surrendered to deep mugs of ale. A record player was playing a crackling rendition of a thirty year old folk song. The speakers were in need of repair, and the music that came out of them resembled the grinding of sandpaper. Nopony seemed to mind; they all had glossy-eyed expressions, especially the closer they hovered about the bar at the lengthy end of the place.\r\n\r\n    Two figures in particular were louder than the rest of the tavern's occupants. One of them was a pink-coated unicorn mare with even pinker locks of hair. The other one... was the target of my insomniac escapade.\r\n\r\n    “Yup...” Straight Edge smirked blearily, took a sip of his mug, and scratched his stubbled chin. “I was part of the crew that built the Equine State Building. I trotted catwalks and platforms with the best of them, riveting pillars into place with pure magic. All the earth ponies had to follow my lead, of course. You know how it is with those poor saps. Without magic, they're as useful as mud.”\r\n\r\n    “Heheheh... You said it!” The unicorn cooed, batting her eyelashes. “They must have really depended on your expertise.”\r\n\r\n    “Darn tootin'.”\r\n\r\n    “How's the skyrise of Manehattan from such a high place?” Her eyes narrowed as her cheeks flushed. “It must be breathtaking!”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmff...” Straight Edge took another sip, gulped down his ale, and smiled liquidly her way. “Trust me, I know a thing or two about taking breaths away, and they both involve my horn.”\r\n\r\n    “Heeheehee...” She fluffed her mane and leaned back against the counter. “Do they, now?”\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath. Icily, I trotted forward.\r\n\r\n    “This place stinks,” Straight Edge muttered.\r\n\r\n    “What, the bar or this country hick town?”\r\n\r\n    “Both. Wanna go somewhere that's really sweet, babe?” Straight Edge asked. “Someplace where it's easier to take your breath away?”\r\n\r\n    I hopped up and squatted on the stool next to the stallion. “I'd not choose the couch. Autumn sleeps on it all the time, apparently.”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge paled.\r\n\r\n    The mare craned her neck and raised an eyebrow at me. “I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n    “I don't mean the October weather,” I muttered without looking. My tired eyes blinked as I stared into the bar. “I mean the name of a mare, a mare who happens to be this pony's wife.”\r\n\r\n    The unicorn squinted hard. She looked quizzically at me, then back to Straight Edge. “I don't... What is this?”\r\n\r\n    “Pffft... Please...” Straight Edge chuckled awkwardly. “You gonna believe the first words to come out of the mouth of any dumb broad who just trots in here?”\r\n\r\n    “No,” she muttered, then frowned. “I suppose I could just stick around long enough until I become a 'dumb broad' to you as well.”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhh... Uhhh...”\r\n\r\n    “Excuse me,” the mare grunted and dismounted from her stool. “But you're right. This place stinks. I think I'll be leaving before it gets more rank.” She slowly left the tavern with a toss of her mane.\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge took a deep breath. His hooves scraped viciously across the bar as he swiveled to aim a glass-cutting glare my way. “Bet you had fun there, huh? Give me one good reason why I shouldn't bend your horn into your eye, lady...”\r\n\r\n    “I know what you do to your children, Straight Edge,” I droned.\r\n\r\n    He stared blankly at me. Something wet was soaking his rear legs. He jumped, seething as he realized that he had let his mug tip over into his lap. He slapped the container down onto the counter and brushed himself off before flashing me an odd squint. “How... did you know my name?”\r\n\r\n    “You heard me just now, didn’t you?” I turned to stare unemotionally at him. “I know what you do to Snips and Windsong.”\r\n\r\n    He was silent as stone. I saw no flicker of conscience in his eyes.\r\n\r\n    That didn't stop me from murmuring onward, “I know that you strangle Snips' until he can barely breathe. I know that you pile all of your troubles, hate, and fear on the poor colt's innocent head. I know that you insult Windsong's intelligence and stunt her growth. On top of all that, I know that you hide all of your ugliness, all of your cruelty, and all of your vices behind the façade of being a good husband for a poor unicorn invalid whom you stopped loving ages ago, as if you ever did to begin with.”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge glared at me, his weathered features frozen in place. In the background, the record was skipping. The sound of scratching thundered briefly through the speakers as the bartender flipped the disc over and trotted back to the bar.\r\n\r\n    “Another drink, Edge?”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge mutely nodded, holding up his mug. The bartender filled his container, then walked up to me. I gently waved him off, and he went back to his duties.\r\n\r\n    Coolly, Straight Edge took another drink, swallowed, and gazed at me. “What the heck is this, anyways?”\r\n\r\n    I stared tiredly at him. It had been twenty-four hours of restless wandering before this moment came, and I could still smell the [color=purple]unsung[/color] rust on my exhausted body. I hoped to Celestia that he could smell it too.\r\n\r\n    “This is the closest thing you're ever going to have to a conscience,” I muttered. “You need to stop what you're doing. You need to stop destroying yourself. I don't know what grief you've been going through, or what pain you're trying to mask. But you are meant to be the pillar of your family. As soon as you let yourself collapse—your faculties and your strengths and your morals—your family will only cave in along with you. That's three lives that you could have been protecting that instead you are throwing into the garbage. Autumn needs you more than ever; that was the reason for moving to this town to begin with, yes? Snips needs a father that can inspire him, not intimidate and anger the poor guy. Your frustration and your wrath: it is being channeled into Snips' peers and friends at school, and if left unchecked it will turn him into a monster. And Windsong? The filly is young, innocent, and full of potential. She's an artist at heart who has yet to discover her cutie mark, and you're wrecking any chance she has to enjoy the most endearing, most pivotal moment of her young life.”\r\n\r\n    I finally pivoted on the stool and faced him, leaning forward with a sincere glint to my eyes.\r\n\r\n    “And what for? Another day spent hiding your anxiety at the bottom of a mug? Another night of yelling fits and domestic strife? I know you hate this town, Straight Edge. I don't know the reason for your hate, but if you took a step back and looked very carefully, you'd realize that this town doesn't hate you. This place is full of love, full of hope, full of ponies who only want what's best for each other. Why can't...”\r\n\r\n    I choked on a seething breath, gritted my teeth, and whispered.\r\n\r\n    “What's so hard, so difficult, so goddess-awfully challenging about the simple notion of accepting help, and admitting you need to change? Admitting that... that you're going about this the wrong way? That it's not too late to begin again, for your family, for yourself?”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge looked at me, his nostrils flaring. He took another sip of his mug, exhaled, and muttered to the musty air of the place, “You know, I used to believe in love.” He stared at the edge of his container as he swirled it around in his grasp. His eyes were twin, jaded marbles. “I used to believe in change. I used to believe in hope and prosperity and all that fruity junk. Heck, I was once as bright and colorful as you. I believed in all that crap so much that I married myself into it. Autumn and I had a wedding. Both of our families were there, smiling. There was celebration, cake, balloons. We had our honeymoon, and it was... really... really sweet. And after that, you know what I found out?”\r\n\r\n    I blinked curiously at him. “What was it? What did you find out?”\r\n\r\n    He took another sip, sighed, and—with a snarl—flung the mug murderously into my face.\r\n\r\n    The shot to my horn was electric enough to wake me from death. Instead, I fell to the floor amidst shards and suds of ale. My ears rang from my collision with the floorboard. Grimacing, I looked up through a trickle of blood to see Straight Edge's hooves landing beside me. My vision trailed up his limbs until I saw a dragonesque snarl to his face as he spat at me.\r\n\r\n    “That all mares are good for nothing leeches!” Straight Edge's voice roared above the sound of nearby patrons gasping. “Acute Magical Disconnect is [i]genetic[/i]! That conniving harlot [i]knew[/i] she had it before she even started dating me! And a single year... a single [i]friggin' year[/i] into our marriage, she becomes a coughing, hacking fit! This so called 'love' you speak so highly about is what ensnared me into being her lifelong money wallet to begin with! Do I hate my children?! You're damn right I detest those stinkin' brats! I hate every goddess-forsaken thing that's squirted out of her! Balls and chains are still balls and chains, no matter how cute they are or much they sob their stupid heads off every time I try to teach them right! You wanna talk about change?! You wanna talk about hope?! Well nothing's ever gonna get frickin' fixed so long as they treat me with the same disrespect as their worthless mother!”\r\n\r\n    “That's enough, Edge!” the bartender growled over the counter. I hadn't realized until now that he had spent the last thirty odd seconds trying to yell above the stallion's enraged voice. He gripped his hoof around what resembled a metal a club as he glared at the drunkard. “I don't care how horrible your Missus is. You don't go tossing patrons around. Not in my tavern.”\r\n\r\n    I stared silently up at Straight Edge, my brow quivering from the fresh pain still coursing through my body.\r\n\r\n    He stood, fuming, cracking the joints in his neck. As everypony nervously watched, he picked a saddlebag up from a nearby stool and fitted it calmly over his haunches. Eventually, he pointed at me and grumbled, “I don't know what stunt you're trying to pull, lady. If it's the bleeding hearts back at Manehattan Social Services, then you can just take a hike. But if I found out that she sent you... if she thought that this was her cowardly way of getting back at me...” He leered as he marched out the door. “I swear to Luna, they're gonna find both of your heads wrapped up in that dirt rag you call a jacket.” He brushed past two patrons and kicked the door open with a rattling of hinges. Starlight briefly parted the haze and disappeared as the door shut on the stunned crowd.\r\n\r\n    I sat up, running a hoof up and calmly feeling the warm blood crawling down my cheek. I looked at my stained limb.\r\n\r\n    “Like that punk even deserves a tab at this point,” the bartender grumbled from behind. He sighed. “I thought I left all the filth back at Mareami....” He leaned over and looked down at me. “Hey, you look busted up pretty bad. Can I get you something for that?”\r\n\r\n    My eyes returned to the door and the cold October night lingering beyond.\r\n\r\n    “Ma'am?”\r\n\r\n    I took a deep, deep breath.\r\n\r\n    “Ma'am, are you okay?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge marched down the center of Ponyville. The moonlight cast a lanky reflection across the dirt and grass. Teetering left and right, he mumbled and grumbled to himself. His eyes blinked, growing progressively more tired with each flutter.\r\n\r\n    He approached a series of closed shops in the market district. Every store was abandoned. Every light was out. A cold wind blew through the street, rustling dust and leaves across the emptiness.\r\n\r\n    “Hrmmf... Frickin' bunch of dirt farmers, I swear to Tartarus...”\r\n\r\n    After such an eloquent statement, he reached back into his saddlebag and pulled out a steel flask. He twisted the cap off with telekinesis, his lips curving slightly. He raised the thing to his lips and took a deep swig.\r\n\r\n    “Mmmmff... nnngh... heheh... 'Ambrosia.' Heh... wonder if she tastes as good as she sounds. Heheheh...”\r\n\r\n    He swirled the flask and lifted it to his lips once again. Nothing went down his throat.\r\n\r\n    “Huh?” He blinked, then realized that he was no longer holding the container. Looking down, he saw that the flask had fallen into the dirt, leaking fluid everywhere. “Oh, for pete's sake...”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge bent down to pick the flask back up.\r\n\r\n    It suddenly shifted from him.\r\n\r\n    He blinked, his brow furrowing. “The hay?!” he remarked, his breath coming out in cold vapors. He watched with a slight shiver as the flask slid out of the street and into the shadow of a nearby alley. His face grimaced. In a drunken stupor, he gazed up at the night sky. He wasn't feeling a brisk wind. Nevertheless, Straight Edge frowned and marched directly after the flask.\r\n\r\n    The darkness of the thin alleyway enshrouded him. He stumbled into a trash can or two, cursing under his breath as a rat squeaked and darted past his teetering legs. Marching over a pile of lumber, be squinted into the deep niche between buildings. Finally, he saw a dim glint of moonlight.\r\n\r\n    “There you are. Ugh... Dang thing's probably covered in filth now.” He walked over to the flask. He bent over to pick it up.\r\n\r\n    And that was when the two-by-four slammed mercilessly into his rear fetlocks.\r\n\r\n    “Aaaaugh!” He shrieked, immediately collapsing forward onto his chest. Straight Edge's muzzle plowed into the concrete. His entire body jerked as he tried to rock his weight back.\r\n\r\n    The same two-by-four pivoted in mid-air, spun with a glow of green magic, and slammed into the knee of his right foreleg.\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh—Goddess!” He yelped, his echoing voice muffled by the height of the two-story brick walls. He rolled over to the ground, paralyzed, clutching his right forelimb and hissing. “Snkkkkt... Aaaagh... haaugh...”\r\n\r\n    The two-by-four was cracked down the center, splintering at the edges. Still, this didn't stop me from dragging it telekinetically across the floor as I marched out of the shadows and loomed above him. My eyes twitched. The shadows were alive with sparks, my sparks.\r\n\r\n    He squealed like an animal giving birth. I could only wish this moment was that holy. He squinted my way, and a bolt of fear shimmered across his glistening eyes. “Who in the hay are you?!”\r\n\r\n    That snarling voice: I suddenly imagined how fitting it would be for rusted shackles to be covering his lips. I adorned his mouth with the full length of the wooden bludgeon instead. With a crack of nebulous thunder, he keeled over, spitting blood into the moonlight. The air smelled of copper, like the rust of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm. I hovered above him, allowing him a feeble chorus of wheezes and whimpers to the bricklaid theatre surrounding us.\r\n\r\n    “Who am I?” I monotoned. “It doesn't matter. You won't remember. And even if you did, it wouldn't matter. You'll still be the one thing poisoning three innocent ponies... a family who has let your anger, ignorance, and bitterness imprison them for far too long.”\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh... Is... Is this... Is this about money?!” Straighted Edge hacked and sputtered my way. I saw his brow furrowed in the dead kiss of night. Even in pain and paralysis, all he had to live on was anger. “Just take my damn saddlebag, ya frickin' psycho!”\r\n\r\n    “This is not about bits!” I shouted and pressed the sharp edge of the sundered bludgeon against his bruised knee. He winced and squirmed as I howled down at him, “This is about tranquility! This is about happiness! Things that will never see the light of day in your household so long as you have power in that worthless horn of yours to bully your children to lifeless husks!”\r\n\r\n    “This... This is about those brats?!” Straight Edge squeaked, his eyes turning round in horror and disbelief. “Lady, you can have them! Say the word, and I'll do anything! J-Just stop hurting me!”\r\n\r\n    “No...” I hissed. “No, you won't change.” My entire body was shivering. Somewhere, the Nightbringer could have been vibrating, and I still wouldn't have been able to tell from the divine ringing in my blood-rushed ears. “Which is why I'm the one who has to make the change, while it's still within my power to do so...”\r\n\r\n    “What...” His face grimaced in confusion. “Wh-What?!”\r\n\r\n    “Didn't you hear me the first time?!” I was fuming; my horn had become a hot, emerald beacon. The shattered two-by-four lifted in my telekinetic grasp, casting a haunted shimmer across the coffin-thin alleyway. “Nopony will know the difference! Not even you! I'm a ghost in this town. History will lurch by, and not a soul will know I was ever here. But you?! Who will miss you when you're gone?!”\r\n\r\n    “Please. Please, lady—”\r\n\r\n    “Who is going to miss you?!” I screamed.\r\n\r\n    He raised his good forelimb over his face, trembling.\r\n\r\n    I was raising the club higher and higher. I seethed.\r\n\r\n    [i]Just smash his horn. Get rid of it. He won't be able to torture his children anymore.[/i]\r\n\r\n    He shivered beneath an emerald shadow. I smelled garbage and sweat and urine.\r\n\r\n    [i]Just get rid of the horn... That's all...[/i]\r\n\r\n    I clenched my teeth. The air was full of vapors. I saw tempests billowing beyond him with each pulsing artery. Thousands upon thousands of souls wailed [color=purple]her[/color] song forever. It was melancholic, wholesome, righteous...\r\n\r\n    [i]Just get rid of him. Get rid of him. Get rid of...[/i]\r\n\r\n    The closet was full of stuffed animals. Moondancer sat in the midst of them, hugging herself, sobbing. I curled up close, but Snips said nothing. She was covered in bruises, confused and alone, with the rain pouring beyond the stairwell like a funeral veil. I pleaded and pleaded for him to tell Twilight and the others the truth, but he refused. The school courtyard was lonely and foggy after she left me. I could never understand pain, could never understand suffering. Straight Edge couldn't understand it either, even then, even as he stared up at me with a bleeding mouth, waiting for me to deliver the final stroke. Soon, nopony would be left to understand.\r\n\r\n    Except me.\r\n\r\n    My seething melted into heaving breaths. My horn stopped glowing. The alleyway reverberated with the echoes of the falling club as I fell to my haunches. My hooves covered my mouth, but it was not enough to dam up the sobs. They came out of me like scalpels, tearing me wide open and inviting tears to wash away the horror of the moment. They failed.\r\n\r\n    I hyperventilated, cowering against the alley wall across from the quivering stallion. His body was branded in my name with bruises and cuts. Every second I spent staring at them, they disappeared beneath a curtain of mist. I was a shivering, crying wreck. Somewhere, a voice whimpered forth.\r\n\r\n    “Are you... Are you...” I squeaked, wheezed, and stammered, “C-can you feel your legs?”\r\n\r\n    He didn't answer me. He was too busy shivering. A cold chill had fallen over the thin space between buildings, and he was spitting blood and vapors into the space between his aching limbs.\r\n\r\n    I gulped. I reached a hoof out towards him. “Sir... Sir, are you okay—”\r\n\r\n    “Nnnngh!” He shook me off, snarling, the whites of his eyes flaring wildly in the moonlight. “Aaaugh! Get away from me!”\r\n\r\n    I jolted from him, gulping a lump down my throat. “I... I'm not...” My face cracked. “I'm not going to h-hurt you...”\r\n\r\n    “Haaaugh... Goddess! Goddess, where am I?! H-how'd this happen?”\r\n\r\n    “Please. I promise, I'm not going to hurt you...” I tried smiling. I only sobbed more instead. “I'm going to get you some help. Please...”\r\n\r\n    “Gnnngh... Just what I friggin' need! Damn it to Tartarus!”\r\n\r\n    “I'm going to get you healed. Just...” I shook my head and gently enshrouded him with emerald magic. “Just trust me, Mr. Edge. Shhh... You're going to be okay.”\r\n\r\n    “How... How did you know...?” He started, but hissed in pain as I did my expert best to levitate him slowly off the floor.\r\n\r\n    In a slow lurch, I carried him across town under the stagnant stars. It took an arduous amount of time. He forgot me at least four times along the way, each time falling into a steeper and steeper panic attack, until the pain and confusion finally overwhelmed him and the battered stallion fell unconscious. It was the first chance I had to hear my own panting breath, and I detested it more than anything that had ever graced my ears before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The next afternoon, I sat on a bench outside Ponyvile Central Hospital. My mane was a mess. My hoodie smelled of sweat and tears. I heard the hooves of ponies shuffling to a stop as they trotted by me. They must have been taking their sweet time to stare at my figure. I could only guess; I had my face cradled in my forelimbs the entire time.\r\n\r\n    There was no sleeping. There was no falling unconscious to this. My heart pulsed steadily, guiltily, for the better part of the agonizingly long day. For once, the chill of the curse wasn't enough to cool the heated knot forming in my stomach.\r\n\r\n    Finally, once my sanity had stretched to the breaking point, I heard the doors to the hospital's front entrance sliding open. I stood up, rubbing the crusty stains of tears off my cheek. I turned and looked, my lips quivering.\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge limped out. He had a crutch around his right forelimb. His rear limbs were bound in gauze, but they managed to carry his weight. A bandage covered half of his face. To my mixed shock, he looked far more angry than in pain. Grumbling to himself, he gave the sunny sky a dejected look, and shuffled ahead with an awkward gait.\r\n\r\n    He was in one piece. Never before in my life did I want to rejoice and hide all at once. Instead, I boldly jumped off the bench, winced from stiff legs, and trotted over to him.\r\n\r\n    “Mister... uh... Mister Edge...”\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh...” He took an extraordinary amount of time to turn around and glare at me. “What in the hay do you want?”\r\n\r\n    “Are you... erm...” I fiddled with the sleeves of my hoodie. “Are you okay? I mean, did the doctors say if you suffered anything truly—?”\r\n\r\n    “Ughh!” He retched and tilted away from me. “Get away from me, ya stinkin' hobo! Goddess, I hate this town!”\r\n\r\n    “Please, I must know—”\r\n\r\n    “For one, [b]no[/b], I'm [i]not okay[/i]!” He snarled. “The damn doctors want to suck me for every bit I got. And for another, why in the flippin' heck would a bum like you care?”\r\n\r\n    “I—”\r\n\r\n    “Get lost, lady!” he grumbled. “I swear to Luna, I can't swing a dead cat in this world without running into a stupid broad! Gaaaaghh!” He growled as he lurched ahead, swearing up a storm beneath his breath before adding, “Last time I have more than three drinks at the Copper Crown. The place is a dump anyways...”\r\n\r\n    I sat on my haunches, gazing after him, hugging myself. The afternoon wore on, and I eventually swiveled about and trotted slowly north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The door opened limply to my cabin. Al immediately pattered up and mewed, rubbing my front limbs affectionately.\r\n\r\n    I gazed dully at him. I saw his empty food dish. Without saying a word, I hovered his bag of feed over and poured some of its contents into the container. I was about halfway through the task when my magic went limp. The bag slumped to the ground, and so did I. I sat with my flank to the cot, staring into space.\r\n\r\n    Al's tail flicked. He gazed at me, then at the mess of food. His whiskers twitched, and suddenly I felt his warm paws crawling up my sweaty body as he sniffed at my muzzle.\r\n\r\n    I blinked a few times. I looked at him. I weakly raised a hoof up.\r\n\r\n    He rubbed against it, nuzzling me closely and purring.\r\n\r\n    I gulped. Quietly, I brought both forelimbs up and engulfed him in a hug. I felt his warmth close to me, and I began sniffling. Clenching my eyes shut, my lips moved to outrace the tears.\r\n\r\n    “Why can't I do it, [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color]?” I whimpered. “Why do I have to be so terribly, stupidly grounded? Why can't I do what needs to be done? I've been a ghost f-for a year now, and... and I just w-won't embrace it. I... I can do so much. I can make a difference. Nopony would need to know what it took. Nopony would n-need to know what I've done to m-make the world more harmonious...”\r\n\r\n    Al curled up against me, adjusting his little furry body to my shivering curves. He tilted his orange face up and meowed.\r\n\r\n    A whimper escaped my mouth. I shuddered and said, “But I would know.” I held him close and nuzzled him, the tears flowing. “I would know.” The sobs came softer this time. I released into the feline's purring side, my voice muffled. “Heaven help me, [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color]. But I'm glad you're gone. You won't have to see it when it happens...” I raised my head and stared, hyperventilating, towards where the Nightbringer was hidden. “You won't have to see me become [color=purple]her[/color]...”\r\n\r\n    Al innocently clung to me as my tears dried up on their own. An hour or so later, I finished feeding him. Then, as evening fell, I turned the lights out, curled up into the cold of my cot, and finally—fitfully—fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I strummed my lyre in the crisp morning air, testing each experimental note against the October breeze, in a desperate attempt to eke whatever lonesome dreams I may have had the night before. I didn't have a chance to remember anything, for soon Cheerilee's voice was merrily chirping in my ear.\r\n\r\n    “I'm so glad that Professor Blue Noise sent you in the first place, but I'm even happier that you overcame your bout with the flu to show up today!” She grinned brighter than the rising sun. In the schoolyard before us, the schoolfoals frolicked and played, enjoying their spare time on the playground before it was time for the start of class. “You can't believe how much of a blessing your visit is to my students. They've been dying to hear about Equestrian music history ever since I made the announcement that we'd have a guest speaker!”\r\n\r\n    “Out of curiosity,” I tiredly mumbled. “What have you been studying all week before I came by?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh, the usual rudimentary math, geometry, and—” Cheerilee paused, her emerald eyes blinking. “Huh...” She rubbed her chin, squinting. “Or did I teach those geometry lessons last week? It's... all a blur for some reason...”\r\n\r\n    I took a deep breath. “Well...” I gave her a weathered smile as I played another tune on the lyre. “I'm sure you kept them happy all the same. And that's what matters when it comes to children.”\r\n\r\n    “Well, happiness is a good thing. Learning, however—heheheh—We can't forget that, now can we!”\r\n\r\n    “We... can forget many things,” I said. I cleared my throat and shrugged. “I guess what I'm trying to say is that you mean more to these kids than knowledge. You... you bring them joy and excitement, Miss Cheerilee. That's something that can't fade from the mind, for it becomes embedded in the heart.”\r\n\r\n    She smiled, her ruby cheeks flushing, if that was even possible. “I like the way you think, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]. Or... heehee... should I say 'feel?'” Her eyes squinted in a brief expression of concern. “Might I ask, though, if you're sure that you're in good health?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, Miss Cheerilee. I'm quite fine.”\r\n\r\n    “Because if you're still under the weather, I'm sure Professor Blue Noise would be more than willing to reschedule until sometime after the upcoming field trip to Canterlot—”\r\n\r\n    “Trust me,” I said with a hint of a growl. Clearing my throat, I gave her the most serene smile I could manage. “I've... I've never been more lucid in my life.”\r\n\r\n    She blinked at that, smiling sheepishly. “Well, alrighty then. I guess we all could do with a bit of—” Her head pivoted aside and her eyes lit up. “Big Mac! You're here!”\r\n\r\n    “Eeeeyup.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh! And you brought more lumber for the upcoming winter!” She shot up from the picnic table beside me. “Here, let me help you with those!” She turned and winked at me. “Excuse me just one moment, Miss [color=green]Heartstrings[/color]. This shouldn't take long.”\r\n\r\n    “Just... [i]uh[/i]... don't wander too far,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n    “Heehee! Perish the thought! Ahem...” She trotted over to the big red stallion as he stood beside the woodbox next to the school building. “Now be careful! I know you're a big fellow, but anypony can get splinters!” He merely chuckled and allowed the schoolteacher to lend a hoof.\r\n\r\n    I watched from afar. I was still strumming on the lyre, but was barely aware of the melody I was making, if any. After my first night's sleep in days, that entire morning felt like a dreamy haze. Then, just like any other vision, I had a wake-up call in the sound of a familiar, rasping voice.\r\n\r\n    “How many times do I have to tell ya, Snails?” Snips grumbled as he waddled within proximity of the picnic table. “I don't want to play any games right now!”\r\n\r\n    “Awwwwww come onnnn!” Snails bounded after him, pouting. “But you never wanna hang out anymore!”\r\n\r\n    “I'm just tired,” Snips grumbled. “And if I wanna get better at pop quizzes, I gotta study and stuff!”\r\n\r\n    Snails' face contorted in confusion. “Errrr... Since when were you so concerned about quizzes?”\r\n\r\n    “Who cares?!” Snips snapped at his tall companion. “So maybe I don't wanna be goofing off all the time! Maybe I don't wanna be worthless!”\r\n\r\n    Snails leaned his head curiously to the side. “You're not worthless, Snips,” he muttered. “You're my bestest friend.”\r\n\r\n    Snips closed his eyes, revealing a slight bruise along his left lid. He sighed and grumbled, “We can hang out later, okay, Snails? Go somewhere and... chase butterflies, or whatever it is you do when I'm not around to keep you out of trouble.”\r\n\r\n    “Butterflies?” Snails stood up straight, blinking steadily. He suddenly gasped, his entire body jumping. “I gotta go save the flowers!” He scampered across the busy playground in a tan blur.\r\n\r\n    “Unnngh...” Snips waddled over until he all-but-bumped into me. “Oh. Music!” He looked up at me, or more appropriately my lyre, squinting. “Hey, uh... You must be that musician that Cheerilee kept telling the class about.”\r\n\r\n    I looked calmly at him. I didn't say anything... not at first.\r\n\r\n    “But... like... I thought you were too sick to show up or something?”\r\n\r\n    After a breath, I gave him a weathered smile. “I got better.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh.” He nodded, then gazed towards the grass beneath his hooves. “That's good, I guess.”\r\n\r\n    “I couldn't miss an opportunity to teach a schoolroom full of foals,” I said, strumming another random tune. “Sharing music is the joy of my life, and I feel that... that everypony deserves to be happy.”\r\n\r\n    “Heh. If you say so,” Snips muttered, toying at the ground with one hoof and then the other. “You picked a silly place to do it.”\r\n\r\n    “Oh?”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah. School is so... so boring,” he muttered. “Now if this was a stage or the Ponyville talent show or... or...”\r\n\r\n    “Do you hate school?” I asked.\r\n\r\n    “Well...” His brow furrowed. “No, I guess not. I mean, yeah, sure, it's boring. But I get to see a bunch of other foals. I get to play jokes on classmates.” He snickered. “I get to hang out with Snails, even if he's a clueless dunce half the time.”\r\n\r\n    “It's relaxing, isn't it?” I said. “Like a good song that keeps changing but stays gentle all the time?”\r\n\r\n    He bit his lip. I heard a sniffling sound, and his head tilted away from my eyes as he muttered, “'Relaxing' is good...”\r\n\r\n    I looked at the lyre, then at him. “When was the last time you got a chance to listen to music?”\r\n\r\n    “I...” He was still looking away from me. His little shoulders shook. “My mom used to sing to me. But... But she doesn't do lullabies anymore.”\r\n\r\n    “No?”\r\n\r\n    “Nah...” He sighed. “It wouldn't be right.”\r\n\r\n    “Wouldn't be right?”\r\n\r\n    He was silent.\r\n\r\n    “You remember them at least, right?” I asked. “Do they relax you to think of them?”\r\n\r\n    He turned to look up at me. His eyes were misty.\r\n\r\n    “Listen to me...” I leaned over, smiling softly. “The music doesn't ever have to die, not so long as we can stand to be happy, wherever we are. It's what we deserve, after all, each and every one of us.”\r\n\r\n    Slowly, his face reflected my smile back. His tail flicked. “You're really gonna share some songs with the class today?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmhmmm,” I said with a nod. “It's... It's the least I can do for you, kiddo.”\r\n\r\n    “Heh...” He nodded slowly, gazing towards the school building where Cheerilee was helping Big Mac with the lumber. “I think I'd like that.”\r\n\r\n    “Hey, boy! C'mere!”\r\n\r\n    Snips' body instantly jolted. I saw his teeth clench. With a shiver, he spun about, briefly blurting, “Gotta go!”\r\n\r\n    I watched as he scampered out of the schoolyard, up a grassy knoll, and into the shadow of a haunting stallion along the dirt path. My breath left me and I stopped strumming the lyre.\r\n\r\n    “You deaf, brat?” Straight Edge grumbled from where he stood on the side of the road with his crutches. “I said get your flank over here!”\r\n\r\n    Snips was frozen in place. For a moment, I didn't understand why, until I saw him shiver from a cold chill running up his body. “Unnngh... Huh? Dad? How did—?”\r\n\r\n    “What are you waiting for?”\r\n\r\n    “I... I don't know. I was just... What was I doing?”\r\n\r\n    “You come to me when I call for you! Ya hear?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmm...” Snips hung his horned head. “Yes, Dad.”\r\n\r\n    “Don't 'yes, Dad' me,” Straight Edge grumbled, then motioned with his bandaged neck. “Shut up and come along. We're going home.”\r\n\r\n    Snips' face scrunched up in confusion. “Uhhh... H-home?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes. You heard me. Home.”\r\n\r\n    “But... But...” He turned and looked over his shoulder at the playground and the bright red building beyond. “It's a schoolday! Should I really be going home?”\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge spun about, his eyes burning like hot coals. “What have I told you about sassin' me in public?!” His horn glowed and there was a fierce, telekinetic tug to Snips' forelimb, dragging the colt towards the adult unicorn. “I got battered by Goddess-knows-what on my way home last night! I'm already paying the doctors out my ears, and now I just found out from my boss at the construction site that I'm not allowed to work until my leg heals up! Which means you're going to have to be at home to help your dear old father around the house!”\r\n\r\n    “But... But...”\r\n\r\n    “You gonna give me lip?! After years of me cleaning up after your crap and buying the food on your plate? You owe me, boy. Don't worry about school. I'm sure your mom has some books for you to learn from at home. Celestia knows she spends all the dang time sitting on her flank, reading them.”\r\n\r\n    “Okay...” Snips dully murmured, hanging his head.\r\n\r\n    “Ugh...” Straight Edge began limping towards the center of town, wincing with each twist of the crutches against his right forelimb. “And let's not drag our tails, ya hear me?! This is embarrassing enough as it is, not that I expect you to understand any...”\r\n\r\n    I saw them beginning to march away. I turned and looked the opposite way. Cheerilee and Big Mac were finishing up with the lumber, completely oblivious. I could have said something. I could have rushed over and told them about Straight Edge whisking Snips' away. I could have done so many bold and dramatic things.\r\n\r\n    I chose to do something else instead. With a calm breath, I levitated the lyre in front of me and loudly—but steadily—strummed a very dear tune to the October winds.\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge and Snips were trotting further down the dirt road. I was starting to have a hard time making out the colt's cutie mark. The muttering curses of his father became a distant hush.\r\n\r\n    Patiently, persistently, I played through the entirety of the song, allowing its melodic notes to rise and fall. I watched with dry eyes. My lungs were frozen with the chill of my ghostly curse.\r\n\r\n    And then—with beauty that rivaled a tiny candle being lit—Snips' body froze as well. He stopped in his tracks, his tiny ears flicking with each rhythmic pitch of “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i].” Any twitch or shiver to his limbs instantly melted. He stayed put where he was.\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge noticed this, of course. Perhaps it was the absence of Snips' pitter-pattering hooves. Perhaps it was the fact that another body wasn't close by to echo his grumbling curses. He swiveled about, blinked at the empty space in the path behind him, and ultimately turned around with a confused frown.\r\n\r\n    “Boy?! Didn't you hear me?! I said we're going home, and that's final!”\r\n\r\n    Snips didn't move. An October breeze wafted by, carrying the sound of [color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color]'s soothing composition. Colts and fillies giggled in the background. I hung in a breathless lurch, waiting.\r\n\r\n    And it happened. “No,” Snips said.\r\n\r\n    Straight Edge turned and loomed viciously over the tiny unicorn. “What... did... you... say...?”\r\n\r\n    It happened again. “No.”\r\n\r\n    I exhaled, only to produce a sharp gasp as Straight Edge flung his crutch down to the dirt, leaned over the petite colt, and hideously snarled, “Boy, I'm not gonna let you push my buttons...”\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh—You're not gonna let me do anything!” Snips suddenly barked up at him. The shivers had returned to his body, but they were righteous quivers of fury. “You're just gonna shout at me and throw me around and call Mom names and make me feel bad about it all!”\r\n\r\n    “Shut your stinkin' trap!” Straight Edge raised a hoof. “Do you know who you're talking to—”\r\n\r\n    “Yes!” Snips shrieked, tears falling from his face as he growled and hissed, “I know how much you hate me and Mom and Windsong! I know how grumpy you get for no good reason! And I'm not going home to that! Not again! Ponies should... sh-should be happy!” He whimpered and yelled at the same time. Foals' heads were turning. The playground was growing silent in the echo of his divine outburst. “All ponies... d-deserve happiness! I don't care how angry you are, but I won't let you stop me from being happy anymore!”\r\n\r\n    “Boy, if you open your mouth one more time—”\r\n\r\n    “Get away from me!” Snips shouted, his teary eyes clenched shut as he started howling over and over and over: “You're a bad father! You're a bad father! You're a bad—”\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh!” Straight Edge slammed his hoof across Snips' horn. With a glowing telekenis, he lifted the sputtering colt up by the neck. “Damn you, brat! I'm gonna do what I should have done the day that stupid wench popped you out!”\r\n\r\n    Colts gasped. Fillies were sobbing. I heard Scootaloo's feareless voice shouting something over and over. I did absolutely nothing, nothing but play the [i][color=cornflowerblue]Echo[/color][/i].\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee had trotted over, drawn by the hellish racket. “What in Equestria's name is going on over there?!” She gasped, her eyes flashing wide. “Good heavens! Snips! Mr. Edge, what are you doing—”\r\n\r\n    “Stay out of this!” Straight Edge growled. “Family business!” He lifted Snips in the air once more.\r\n\r\n    “He... He can't breathe!” Cheerilee shrieked. She spun around, then yelled towards the schoolhouse. “Big Mac! Quick! He's going to strangle Snips!”\r\n\r\n    “Eeeenope,” Big Mac growled, his teeth gritting. On thundering hooves, he galloped across the schoolyard. Dust kicked up in a storm as he barreled directly into Straight Edge, body-slamming the yelping unicorn to the dirt road.\r\n\r\n    “Aaaaugh!” Straight Edge sneered. “What the—Get off me, you lousy hick—!” Big Mac's response was an iron hoof bucked through Straight's teeth. “Grrnkktl—Aaaugh!”\r\n\r\n    “Woohoo!” Apple Bloom jumped up and down, pumping a forelimb. “You show that creep, Macky!” Scootaloo joined her cheers. Sweetie Belle trembled and covered her eyes while Rumble hugged her comfortingly, smiling from a distance.\r\n\r\n    “Nnngh—You lousy piece of farm filth!” Straight Edge was rambling, raving, his eyes bright and murderous. He could only struggle and moan as Big Mac shoved him prone to the soil. “Ghhh—Worst town ever! I'll rip all your hearts out! So help me—Ooof!” His mouth ate dirt as Big Mac applied his weight into the back of his head.\r\n\r\n    In the meantime, Cheerilee was rushing over to Snips' quivering body. She squatted down and scooped him up. “Snips! Snips, you poor, poor thing! Can you breathe?”\r\n\r\n    Snips sputtered, gasped for breath. He curled up into Cheerilee's embrace and nodded weakly. “Y-yes,” he murmured. “Please, k-keep him away from me. He's so horrible. All the time... so horrible...”\r\n\r\n    “Oh Snips...” She leaned in and nuzzled him as if he was her own foal. “Absolutely! You have my word, he won't touch you ever again!” Her eyes were moist as she stammered, “If I had only known sooner. Oh good heavens, you poor thing!”\r\n\r\n    “Mom... Windsong...” He shivered and clung to her in between desperate sobs. “They... They need...”\r\n\r\n    “He won't touch them either. Don't you worry one bit.” She looked at the line of gaping foals. Clearing her tears, she managed to summon one of them. “Snails. Come here...”\r\n\r\n    The tall colt wandered over, shivering, staring at his sobbing friend with wide eyes. “Y-y-yes, Miss Ch-Cheerilee?”\r\n\r\n    “Snips is going to be okay. But I need you to run into town and fetch the police. Can you do that for me? For your friend?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhhh... S-Sure thing!”\r\n\r\n    “Good. Don't worry. Big Mac has things taken care of here. Now go, Snails! Run!”\r\n\r\n    Snails ran into the center of town, beyond earshot of Straight Edge's frustrated growls.\r\n\r\n    Cheerilee cradled Snips closer, smiling and murmuring to him, “Shhhh. It's okay, darling. You're safe now. Don't be afraid...”\r\n\r\n    “N-not afraid...” Snips hiccuped, covering his wet eyes with his forelimbs. “Not afraid anymore... Not afraid anymore...”\r\n\r\n    “Shhh... It's alright, Snips,” she said tearfully. “It's alright to cry. Just let it out... It's alright...”\r\n\r\n    “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i]” finally stopped, only because I couldn't manage it anymore. I was clinging my lyre to my chest, hugging it like Cheerilee hugged Snips. My head tilted towards the morning sky as my face cracked, letting loose the first of several heavy sobs. My lips stretched between a smile and a grimace as I clenched my eyes shut and whimpered to the sky. Two little words squeaked through my teeth, over and over again, until I no longer had the strength to remember who exactly I was thanking anymore.\r\n\r\n    And neither did I care. Eventually, the police came by to assist Big Mac with the raging unicorn. The schoolfoals gathered around Cheerilee to help comfort Snips. And a certain ghost who may have never been there to begin with was suddenly gone. Only the music remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    “There's some news about Straight Edge,” Twilight Sparkle said at a table in Sugarcube Corner a few days later.\r\n\r\n    “You mean that unicorn jerk who was beating up his kids or whatnot?” Rainbow Dash paused in sipping her soda to frown. “Did they hang him from the gallows?”\r\n\r\n    “Rainbow Dash, honestly!” Twilight Sparkle made a face. “What is this, the Solar Civil War era?!” She calmly folded up a newspaper and gazed at Rainbow Dash and Applejack. “They decided not to give him bail. He's remaining under lock and key until they can get him into court. There was some dirt dug up on the workhorse, and apparently Mr. Edge was wanted for insurance fraud back in Manehattan. The Equestrian Bureau of Investigations have been looking all over for him for years. Guess they never thought to check in Ponyville.”\r\n\r\n    “In other words, he's gotta go through a lot of lousy red tape before anypony punishes him for treating foals like punching bags,” Rainbow Dash grunted. “Where's the justice in that?!”\r\n\r\n    “I don't think it's anythang worth complainin' about, Rainbow,” Applejack said. “What matters is that he's been caught red-hoofed, and t'ain't nothin' more he can do to them poor ponies he was livin' with.”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, but still, it just really stinks,” Rainbow Dash said, folding her forelimbs and frowning. “Doesn't it bother you guys to know that he was living in our very own neighborhood, abusing his own flesh and blood, and none of us were any the wiser?! I mean, how does junk like that happen in this day and age?! Wouldn't it, like, freak the heck out of Princess Celestia to hear about this kind of stuff?”\r\n\r\n    Twilight took a deep breath, fiddling with her hooves on the edge of the table. “If Celestia can't stop every bad thing from happening, what makes us think any single one of us can do any better?”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, but...” Rainbow Dash sat back with a slump, sighing. “When crud like this makes the light of day, it makes me wonder if we're not trying hard enough. I mean, are we the Elements of Harmony or aren't we?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh don't get all mopey like that, sugarcube,” Applejack said with a gentle smile. “Heaven knows, yer the bravest, most thoughtful pony in town. The first hint you'd catch of bad things happenin', you'd be there to play hero in a jiffy!” She turned to wink at Twilight. “Reckon that's the same for everypony seated here, and the rest of the gang to boot.”\r\n\r\n    “There's no perfect way to make a perfect world,” Twilight Sparkle said. “Making life harmonious is... is just like making friends.” She smiled sweetly. “There's bound to be a lot of bumps along the way.”\r\n\r\n    “And most likely everypony in Ponyville has more than a lick of sense ever since Straight Edge showed his true colors.” Applejack turned toward Rainbow Dash. “If you wanna get started on playin' neighborhood watch, Rainbow, now's yer chance.”\r\n\r\n    “Heh. Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.” She lifted up towards the ceiling on flapping wings. “Say, I don't normally suggest this, but what if we call the other girls over to the library for a special meeting or something? I think it'd be totally cool if we set up some community thing to... I dunno... try to reach out to the families around town about what's happened. What do you think?”\r\n\r\n    “I, for one, find that to be a brilliant idea!” Twilight Sparkle hopped up with a grin. “And I think you deserve the honor of setting it up, Rainbow!”\r\n\r\n    “Darn tootin'!” Applejack added. She stood up and planted her hat on her head. “Where to, Cap'n my Cap'n?”\r\n\r\n    “Let's round up Rarity from the Boutique first!” Rainbow said, pointing towards the door as the three made their exit. “You know how long it takes her to get ready for last-second get togethers!”\r\n\r\n    “Pfft! That fussy filly! If it was the end of the world, she'd be frettin' about her eyelashes!”\r\n\r\n    “Well, thankfully, we won't be having to hold back the apocalypse anytime soon,” Twilight said.\r\n\r\n    The three friends giggled as they left. Passing by them, several young foals scampered into the heart of Sugarcube Corner. It was a veritable parade of school-aged ponies. Cheerilee stuck her head in through the door and called out to them.\r\n\r\n    “Now, don't spend all your lunch money! And only get fruit or juice! We have a long train ride ahead, and I can't have my little ponies bouncing completely off the walls!”\r\n\r\n    “[b]Yesssss, Miss Cherileeeee,[/b]” the group chanted back in unison. Cheerilee giggled and stood in the doorway, speaking with Big Mac and another chaperone.\r\n\r\n    “Oooh! Strawberry Supreme! Strawberry Supreme!” Snails hopped up and down while a few other kids hoofed bits over the counter to Ms. Cake, receiving juice boxes and apple slices in return. “We gotta combine our bits to get the Strawberry Supreme juice!”\r\n\r\n    “What?!” Snips retorted, snapping him a crazy look. “But it's just one juice box! I know it's big, but how are we both gonna share it?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhhhhhhhh—We'll buy two straws!”\r\n\r\n    “Snails!” Snips gasped. “You're a genius!”\r\n\r\n    “Hehehhhh.”\r\n\r\n    “But... Uhm... Oh drat!” Snips fiddled with a saddlebag on his portly haunches. “We're both one bit short! I think we gotta have the smaller juice boxes. That means no Strawberry Supreme.”\r\n\r\n    “Awwwww...” Snails' ears drooped as his muzzle hung low to the floor.\r\n\r\n    Just then, three golden coins landed between the two colts. “There you go. Get yourself two Strawberry Supremes.”\r\n\r\n    The two young unicorns gasped at that bits. They turned and looked at me. “Whoah! Lady, are you serious?!”\r\n\r\n    I smiled softly from where I sat in a chair with my lyre. “I'm always serious,” I said, then chuckled. “To a fault.” I motioned towards the distant counter. “Knock yourselves out.”\r\n\r\n    “Sweeeeeeet!” Snails exclaimed.\r\n\r\n    “Here, Snails!” Snips slid the bits over to him. “Go buy us the Strawberry Supremes, and all the straws you can fit into your mouth!”\r\n\r\n    “Sure thing, buddy!” The taller colt grabbed the coins in his teeth and galloped towards a grinning, cheerful Ms. Cake.\r\n\r\n    “You going somewhere special today?” I asked.\r\n\r\n    Snips spun to look at me. “Huh? Oh...” He smiled, his tail flicking excitedly. “Miss Cheerilee is taking us on a field trip to the Canterlot gardens! We're gonna see a huge maze and a bunch of statues and flags and stuff!”\r\n\r\n    “Wow...” I said with a nod. “Sounds really boring.”\r\n\r\n    “Snkkkt-Hahaha!” He broke into giddy laughter. “Heh... Yes, well...” He exhaled calmly and glanced at the far wall of the eatery. “I never used to go on field trips.” He gulped. “My... uh... My dad would say that they were just a waste of time.”\r\n\r\n    “That doesn't sound very nice... or sensible.”\r\n\r\n    “Yeah, well, that's my dad for ya,” Snips momentarily grumbled. A joyful smile returned to his lips. “But I don't have to worry about him anymore. He's somewhere else right now, and the family's better off.”\r\n\r\n    “I'm... I'm sorry,” I said softly. “I shouldn't have pressed...”\r\n\r\n    “No! No, it's okay... I just...” Snips breathed deeply and looked up at me. “I just never knew that things could feel so... so weightless, y'know? Heehee... I feel like I have pegasus wings hidden beneath my skin, cuz it's like I'm flying!”\r\n\r\n    I nodded. “So you're happy, then?”\r\n\r\n    “Happiest I've been in a while,” Snips said. “And so's my Mom and sister. We're staying at Snails' family's house, and they're all so nice and fun to be with. Plus, a bunch of ponies came to help my Mom. They say that she's going to get better, that they're gonna help get rid of her sickness. And... And...”\r\n\r\n    “Hey...”\r\n\r\n    He blinked, staring fixedly at me.\r\n\r\n    I smiled. “This happiness you feel? You can get other ponies to feel it, in ways that your dad never did.”\r\n\r\n    His lips hung open for a spell, and soon he murmured, “I know.” He gulped. “For a while there, I was afraid that... that...”\r\n\r\n    “Shhh...” I leaned forward and smiled at his eye level. “We all have plenty of time, kiddo, to become that which we want to be, and not that which we fear.”\r\n\r\n    Snips stared at me. His next smile was a warm thing, like one of Cheerilee’s cutie marks. At around that time, Snails scampered up, levitating two containers.\r\n\r\n    “Juuuuuuuuice boxesssss!” he triumphantly chirped.\r\n\r\n    At the exit to the eatery, Cheerilee was calling forth, “Okaaaaay, my little ponies! Time to go! The train won't wait!”\r\n\r\n    “We gotta go, Snips!”\r\n\r\n    “Yes! Just one second!” The stout unicorn turned around. “Hey, ma'am, thanks for the talk. I think...” He blinked. The space before him was empty. “Ma'am?”\r\n\r\n    “Who were you talkin' to, Snips?”\r\n\r\n    He teetered suddenly. With chattering teeth, he crubbed his forelimbs together. “Yeesh. Did somepony leave the freezers open in this place?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhhhh—Snips! We gotta go! Cheerilee is frowning at us! I haaaate it when Cheerilee frowns!”\r\n\r\n    “Er... Right! Onwards to Canterlot!”\r\n\r\n    Snails scampered out of Sugarcube Corner, as did the rest of the schoolfoals. Snips followed up the rear, balancing the juice box atop his head, as well as a song that he hummed in the pleasant air of the place, a very relaxing tune...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [i][color=green]I hear the knock on the dormitory door, and somehow I know it can't be anypony else but her. I trot over and open it. Nothing can prepare me for how miserable, how utterly cold and lonely she looks.\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer!” I exclaim. It is true shock. I rest a hoof over my chest as she fidgets in the sorority hallway. “I... I...” I gulp and smile nervously. “Why don't you come in?”\r\n\r\n    “Uhm...” She squirms where she stands. “Are... Are your roommates...?”\r\n\r\n    “We're alone. The girls are out partying on the edge of the Shadow District.”\r\n\r\n    “Hmmph...” She finally trudges in, dragging a saddlebag limply behind her. “You should be with them.”\r\n\r\n    “I'd rather be here, really,” I say in a low tone. I slowly close the door behind her. “Besides, those... uh... those bat ponies freak me out in that side of town.”\r\n\r\n    “Liar,” she grumbles, pacing across the shadowed room. “You're just like Twilight. Anything you fear has an academic buffer.” She looks with disgust at the cluster of junk lying around the place. “Blessed Luna, your roommates are a bunch of slobs!”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer...”\r\n\r\n    “Or did a certain mint-green unicorn lose her ladylike grace since the last time we chatted?”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer, I know why you're back in Canterlot,” I say as I trot towards her. I raise a hoof up to her shoulder, but I think twice about making contact. Biting my lip, I hesitate, then say, “When I heard, I... uh... I visited your mom.”\r\n\r\n    She gulps. She hangs her head. “I know.”\r\n\r\n    I blink in surprise. “You... You spoke with her?”\r\n\r\n    “Mmmhmmm.” She nods slowly. “Just now.”\r\n\r\n    The room is silent for a while. I shuffle my hooves and circle through the gray shadows until I am standing in front of her. Her violet and red mane is so straight. Her violet eyes are so jaded. This is my good friend, and yet it isn't. I try to keep my voice steady.\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer, I... You know that when I try to say things, I only ramble on endlessly. You were right all along about me. You always were. I never went through all the horrible things you did. How could I possibly relate? And furthermore—”\r\n\r\n    “What's worth relating to?” she mutters. “It's very simple, Lyra.” She tilts her head up and stares blankly at me. “He's dead. He croaked, kicked the bucket, knocked on death's door. Heck, Lyra, you're a poet...”\r\n\r\n    “Musician.”\r\n\r\n    “Whatever. Describe it any way you want.” She takes a deep breath and marches over to stare out the window. She doesn't bother to push the curtains open. “He's gone. He's gone and... and...”\r\n\r\n    “And what, Moondancer?”\r\n\r\n    “I talked to Mom. I even paid Twilight's folks a visit. And yet... And yet none of them could help me... Not like you could...” She rubs her other forelimb with a hoof and whimpers the next part out. “Like you always could...”\r\n\r\n    “How...” I stammer, honestly perplexed, flabbergasted even. “Moondancer, really?” I give a bitter chuckle. “How did I ever help you? I was—”\r\n\r\n    “You were there, Lyra. You were always there, each time I needed you, and even the times when I didn't... or pretended that I didn't. And I treated you like dirt for no good reason.”\r\n\r\n    “Heh... Moondancer...” I shake my head and look at the carpet. “You didn't treat me like—”\r\n\r\n    “I treated you like dirt!” she snarls, her voice starting to shake. “I crushed you and ditched you because... because I was so angry, and so...” She shudders visibly, her back hunching. “So scared that this day would come, and I would have to tell you... t-tell you...”\r\n\r\n    I look up, concerned. “Tell me what, Moondancer?”\r\n\r\n    She turns around, and her eyes are glittering with tears. “That... That I feel so horrible.” She inhales sharply, her face grimacing. “He's dead, and now that he is, I feel s-so horrible, Lyra, and I... I-I don't understand why!”\r\n\r\n    “Well... uhm... he was your father, Moondancer—”\r\n\r\n    “He was a jerk!” she shrieks, grimacing harder. “He was a sadist and an abuser and a dirty, dirty creep and now that he's dead I should be happy, but... but I-I can't feel it, Lyra! You say that you could never relate?! I was his dang d-daughter, and I can't understand either! How does that even make any s-sense?”\r\n\r\n    “Moondancer, I don't think you give yourself enough credit!” I exclaim. “I know you must think that the two of you were always cut from the same cloth, but—”\r\n\r\n    “But what?!” Moondancer sobs. She staggers slightly, running a hoof over her face. “Lyra, he... he was everything bad and h-horrible in my life! He w-was... was like the sc-scale I had for all things awful!” She hiccups and hugs herself. “I-I think the real reason I... I haven't settled down with a stallion yet, or even g-gotten a coltfriend, is that... that I'm afraid, Lyra. You know I've always wanted kids of my own someday. But how...” Her eyes clench shut and she shudders. “H-how could a pony like m-me do anything but mess that up?”\r\n\r\n    “Oh Moondancer...” I smile and clear the gap between us finally, flinging my forearms around her. “You would have the best, most healthy, most fortunate foals in the world...”\r\n\r\n    “I've been so sc-scared for so long, Lyra...” She clings to me, burying her face in my shoulder. “I don't want anything like th-that to happen. Celestia, help me, I-I don't ever want to b-become him...”\r\n\r\n    “Shhh... You won't become him, Moondancer,” I say, holding her close. “I won't let you. You hear me? I won't let you become him...”\r\n\r\n    She sniffles, sobbing and laughing at the same time as she surrenders to my embrace. “Thank you, Lyra. I just... I just need you to be here... Th-that's what I've always needed. Just for you to be here...”\r\n\r\n    “Shhhh...” I nuzzle Moondancer, rocking her gently as I murmur into her ear. “And I always will be.” I smile. “Always...”[/color][/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    As the [i]Requiem[/i] played in full, I stood alone, a dot of warmth in the center of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm. Slowly, I tilted my face up. The shackled ponies on either side of me barely stirred. The thunder was low.\r\n\r\n    The spheres within spheres loomed overhead, as they always did, an eerie accompaniment to the fluctuating tempests.\r\n\r\n    “I know that [color=purple]you[/color]'re here,” I said calmly, clinging to the Nightbringer. “What I don't know, and what I'll never know, is just [i]how long[/i] [color=purple]you[/color]'ve been here.” I gulped and murmured, “Just like nopony knows how long I've been haunting the grounds to which [color=purple]your[/color] curse has anchored me.”\r\n\r\n    The spheres floated in place. There was no song. No lightning. No stirring whatsoever.\r\n\r\n    I bravely continued, “I've been a very fortunate pony. I wake up everyday knowing that; it's what makes the curse so potent. But...” I hesitated slightly, then hoarsely spoke, “I also know that I've been a very blind pony, and an ignorant one. I look back at my life before all of this happened and I think—no—I [i]know[/i] that I'm better for all that's happened to me. I'm wiser, stronger...” I clenched my eyes shut and saw Straight Edge's frightened face in the midnight of my mind. “...but I'm far from perfect.”\r\n\r\n    A few of the ponies rattled on the lengths of their chains. Mists of water flew coldly over the platform before rejoining the chaotic nether.\r\n\r\n    “I want to become better. I want to be a good pony, to reach out to those around me. I...” I bit my lip. My eyes opened from the tears springing forth as I shuddered and looked up at [color=purple]her[/color] throne, whimpering. “I want to bless others in this world. I want to leave my mark, if only to guide ponies along the path towards harmony and righteousness. And now that... now that so much has happened in my life and I've learned what I've learned, I...” I hiccuped on another sob and squeaked forth, “I can't do a single thing. Not without a miracle or an event of pure happenstance.”\r\n\r\n    I clung tighter to the Nightbringer, falling on my knees as I gazed up at the spheres, teary-eyed.\r\n\r\n    “Is it so selfish of me, so unholy of a demand, that I ask for yet another miracle?” I gulped and tried to keep my breaths even. “Please... Please speak to me. Sing to me. I ask of [color=purple]you[/color]... I beg of [color=purple]you[/color]... Come and play the [i]Duet[/i] with me. Help me break free from this curse. And maybe—just maybe—I can find a way to help [color=purple]you[/color] too.” I gulped and stammered, “Because nopony—mortal or immortal—would live in a place like this unless it was their prison. And though I may never want to become [color=purple]you[/color], that doesn't mean...” I smiled weakly through the tears. “That doesn't mean that I can't try and understand [color=purple]you[/color].”\r\n\r\n    The spheres hovered coldly ahead. I saw strobes of light, distant and erratic, illuminating the lengths of the firmaments beyond.\r\n\r\n    “Please...?” I squeaked again. “All I can do is be here. Won't [color=purple]you[/color] help me? Won't [color=purple]you[/color] free me?” My limbs went limp, and I almost dropped the Nightbringer right then and there. “What is it that keeps [color=purple]you[/color] from at least talking to me? Must we play this game of hide and seek for eternity? Must [color=purple]you[/color] ignore me? I beg of [color=purple]you[/color], what's keeping us from finishing the Nocturne?”\r\n\r\n    Just then, the lightning bolts in the distance doubled, tripled. I heard the rattling of chains. They intensified all around me, forming a cacophony of passion and chaos, until the chanting chorus of every shackled pony in every corner of the [color=purple]unsung[/color] realm broke through, moaning the same hideous phrase over and over again.\r\n\r\n    [b]“[color=purple]Her[/color] beloved wakes! [color=purple]Her[/color] beloved wakes! [color=purple]Her[/color] beloved wakes!”[/b]\r\n\r\n    I gasp, my wide eyes staring at all the quivering equines as they thrashed and howled around me.\r\n\r\n    [b]“[color=purple]Her[/color] beloved! [color=purple]Her[/color] beloved! [color=purple]Her[/color] beloved! [color=purple]Her[/color] beloved!”[/b]\r\n\r\n    They were surrounding me, lashing at me and each other, writhing in agony and fear and joy all at once. Overwhelmed, I scrunched down on the ground and telekinetically strummed “[i][color=cornflowerblue]Penumbra's Echo[/color][/i]” in quick fashion. Before their chains and chants could drown me, the unsung realm flew away in a blur, and I was once again situated on the lantern-lit floor of my cellar, surrounded by dust and the echoing sounds of my panting voice.\r\n\r\n    I sat up, running a shivering hoof through my mane as my tears dried and my voice found its way back into my throat. “[color=purple]Her[/color]... '[color=purple]H[/color]-[color=purple]Her[/color] beloved wakes?'” My brow furrowed. “But... But what...?”\r\n\r\n    The air was still. I felt as though the world had stopped rotating.\r\n\r\n    Yet again, nothing had become of the trip to purgatory.\r\n\r\n    With a sigh, I bagged the Nightbringer, extinguished the lantern, and trudged up the steps to the surface. “Something... doesn't make sense. [color=purple]She[/color] didn't try blasting me off the face of the platform that time. Did I actually reach [color=purple]her[/color]?” I sighed again. “[color=cornflowerblue]Alabaster[/color], how did you dwell in that place for a single day, much less a thousand years? No wonder you lost your mind...”\r\n\r\n    I opened the door to my yard. Instead of sunlight, I was greeted with a pie to the face.\r\n\r\n    “Gaaugh!” I stumbled back, reeling. Clumps of cherry, custard, and whipped cream covered my horn, eyes, and muzzle. Wincing, I brought two hooves up and wiped the edible material out of sight. “For the love of Celestia,” I was already growling. “Pinkie Pie! If you're tossing baked goods at random again...” I froze as soon as my eyes could blink.\r\n\r\n    There were four more pies where the first one came from, and they were... levitating over the lawn behind my cabin in tight formation. I saw more things floating in the distance. Squinting, I made out what was undeniably a flock of winged pigs. To my horror, there were spherical clusters of landscape floating, embedded with trees and upside down cottages. Above this chaotic sprawl, bright clouds of pink fluff lingered, occasionally precipitating disgusting brown sheets of rain onto a Ponyville fragmented into labyrinthine facsimiles of what it was just hours ago.\r\n\r\n    It looked far too goofy to be true, too haunting and bizarre to be taken any way but seriously. In a way, it looked perfectly like—\r\n\r\n    “The end of the world...”\r\n\r\n    I looked at the mess above and beyond. Slowly, I tilted around and gazed down the steps to my cellar. I blinked, hearing several eerie words repeating in my mind. In a flash, I galloped towards the cabin, flinging the last flakes of pie off my face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Even an entire year of understanding new things couldn’t prepare me for what happened next...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[center][b][color=green]Background Pony[/color]\r\n\r\nXV - “Being There”[/b]\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nby shortskirtsandexplosions\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to: [url=http://www.fimfiction.net/user/RazgrizS57]RazgrisS57[/url], [url=http://www.fimfiction.net/user/theworstwriter]theworstwriter[/url], [url=http://www.fimfiction.net/user/PropMaster]Props[/url], [url=http://www.fimfiction.net/user/TheBrianJ]theBrianJ[/url], [url=http://www.fimfiction.net/user/WardenPony]Warden[/url], [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBZ1e5YAHzk]Led[/url] [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39ASF9vdOUI]Zeppelin[/url], and [url=http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae323/arielstreasures/belle21.gif]capitalism[/url]\r\n\r\nCover pic by Spotlight[/center]\r\n\r\n
"; //Background Pony, chapter 1, by ShortSkirtsAndExplosions
pub const EV_ESY: &str = "
As anypony who’s ever met Pinkie Pie can tell you, the line between absolute genius and absolute idiocy is exceedingly thin. \r\n\r\nExtremes, you see, are closer to each other than to the center; reality is shaped like a horseshoe in that way. Anything, while pushed to its absolute limit, will start to resemble its total opposite. This is the so-called Law of Political Cartoonists, and it’s an undeniable truth.\r\n\r\nConsider, now, [i]an extremely benevolent monarch.[/i]\r\n \r\nCelestia was drinking chamomile tea that morning, and having a pleasant chat with her sister while handling some extremely important papers. They were the kind of papers that included the words “war,” “minotaur,” and “imminent death” in bold letters. They were the bureaucratic equivalent of a big red button branded [b]END OF THE WORLD JUST PUSH HERE[/b].\r\n\r\nAnd Celestia was barely glancing at them. \r\n\r\n“So let me get this straight,” Luna was saying, tapping her cup of tea. It was empty already. “We do not approve of slavery anymore.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Because of politics.”\r\n\r\nCelestia looked to the side. She had perfect posture—you could use her back to measure the angles of the walls. “Well, King Sombra gave slavery a bad name, I’m afraid. Also, we believe in the idea of freedom, and how every pony deserves a list of fundamental rights.”\r\n\r\n“Because of politics. I see.” Luna nodded, and pointed at Celestia. “But we do not pay our Royal Guards.”\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n“No. No, we don’t.”\r\n\r\n“But they are not [i]slaves.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“No,” Celestia said. “They’re volunteers. They offer their services to the Crown, and—”\r\n\r\n“And Spike.”\r\n\r\nAnother pause, this time shorter. Celestia cocked her head to the side. “Spike?”\r\n\r\n“Spike,” Luna said. “Last name ‘Dragon’, middle name ‘the’. He follows every single one of Twilight Sparkle’s orders, and lives and dies by her word. But, I take, he is not a slave.”\r\n\r\nCelestia frowned. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a servant carrying two more cups of tea—and signaled him to serve them. Hot water, a bit of milk, and ready. “Well,” she said. “I wouldn’t say he [i]lives and dies[/i] by her word, although I’ll admit that’s a morally gray situation.”\r\n\r\nLuna took the new cup of tea and sipped from it. “Then I—eugh. Eeeugh. This tastes like lava, Sister.”\r\n\r\n“And how does lava taste like, again?”\r\n\r\n“Hot dirt.”\r\n\r\nCelestia sighed. “I like chamomile tea.”\r\n\r\n“Horrible taste.” Luna put the teacup down, and then looked at Celestia. “Okay. Cows.”\r\n\r\n“…Cows.”\r\n\r\n“Cows. What [i]are[/i] cows?”\r\n\r\nCelestia gave this a little bit of thought, and eventually put the [b]END OF THE WORLD JUST PUSH HERE[/b] papers to the side. “I don’t—are we talking biology, or politics?”\r\n\r\n“Politics.” A beat. “Wait. Cows have not evolved too much in the last thousand years, right? They are the same as when I was banished.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Thank the stars.” Luna made a gesture as if to sweep the sweat away from her head. With the spoon. “I am still not over what happened to the possums. Okay, then—politics, Sister. We are talking politics. What are cows?”\r\n\r\n“They’re…” Celestia frowned. “Um. Well.”\r\n\r\n“They are slaves.”\r\n\r\n“They’re.” Celestia squinted. “Hmm. Luna, you must understand a Princess must always measure her words when—”\r\n\r\n“You are looking for a way to say ‘slaves’ in a politically correct way.”\r\n\r\n“I’m more lenient to ‘second-class citizens’ personally.”\r\n\r\nLuna replied to this with the biggest of smirks, which, in Celestia’s opinion, was about the worst way for a monarch to react to the discovery that their society has second-class citizens. “That is more like it. I dislike politics, Sister. I believe they come from a place of dishonesty. I am not saying I support slavery, but only a fool would—”\r\n\r\nCelestia arched an eyebrow. “You adored having slaves.”\r\n\r\n“They were [i]really convenient.[/i]” Luna brandished the spoon once more. “You know what, Sister? We should become despots. That sounds like fun.”\r\n\r\nCelestia rolled her eyes, took a sip of tea… \r\n\r\nAnd something interesting happened.\r\n\r\nIt tasted horrible. The tea—the one Celestia had picked herself, her favorite tea—tasted extremely unpleasant to her tongue. She did not show this in her face, but her ears did perk up in surprise. Chamomile tea, and she disliked it.\r\n\r\nSo she said, “Well, now I wonder if we should become tyrants.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” Luna looked at her ears, and understanding dawned on her. “Oh. The tea?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed. Do you think it will be hard? To rule under with an iron hoof?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am sure we’ll manage.”\r\n\r\nAnd that’s all it took. \r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months of darkness, and Canterlot looked exactly the same—but for a Castle that was now black, and with enough spikes to make a young dragon feel inadequate. It was a hedgehog made building. Celestia now lived in a giant morning star.\r\n\r\nDaring Do, hero extraordinaire, arrived upon Canterlot Castle with her hat in one hoof and her whip in the other. \r\n\r\nThe BOOM! of the doors to the Throne Room being kicked open echoed through the halls of the Castle like thunder through an open field, and Daring Do lowered her leg, teeth bared in a wolfish snarl. “Celestia!” she said, and her voice was raw with the thirst for [i]justice.[/i]\r\n\r\nCurtains drawn, deep purple walls—the Throne Room was cast in the darkest of shadows. At the end, lit by candlelight, lay an obsidian throne. Sitting on it, snow-white coat stark against the black jewels that now adorned her chest and hooves, was Celestia, the Tyrant Queen. A blood-red crown rested on her head.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and it was the pleasant, gentle smile Daring Do had known and loved for so many years. “Daring Do,” the Tyrant said. “What a pleasant surprise.”\r\n\r\n“Your reign is over,” Daring said. “I never thought the day when you and I fought would come, Princess… If you’re still deserving of that title.” And with absolute finality, Daring brandished her whip and pointed at Celestia. “But this is it. I’ve come to free Equestria from you. [i]The sun is not the only thing going down tonight![/i]”\r\n\r\nCelestia cackled. Well, more like gently chuckled, but her official title was Tyrant so legally that was a cackle. “My dear Daring Do, I’m afraid that’s [i]not my cup of tea.[/i]”\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n“…Um.” Celestia blinked, and something that might as well have been pink rose to her cheeks. “Sorry, I—was that not appropriate? I feel that wasn’t appropriate. I’m sorry, I’m just not really used to this yet. May we start over again?”\r\n\r\nDaring Do squinted. “Do not play with me. You kidnapped—”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course. This is embarrassing. I apologize.” Celestia sighed, and then offered Daring Do a little smile. “I hope you do not mind if I contact my sister, Daring Do. She’s more experienced in the matters of villainy, I admit.” And her horn lit up.\r\n\r\nDaring Do immediately tensed, and her hoof went straight for the saddlebag. “Oh, no!” she yelled. “You do—”\r\n\r\nWith a [i]poof![/i] and a bit of sparkly smoke, Luna appeared right next to Celestia. She had fangs, now, and bat-like wings. Her mane and fur were both darker. “Sister? I was about to greet the Minotaur King.”\r\n\r\n“Luna,” Celestia said. “I’m sorry, I just—I couldn’t do it. I’m afraid I messed up the one-liner.”\r\n\r\n“Aw, really? We practiced so much, too. Such a shame.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\nLuna shook her head. “No, no. Nopony ever said it was easy.” Then, she noticed Daring Do, who was still dramatically reaching into her saddlebag, and was by now feeling oddly inadequate. Like when you forget to take off your hotdog costume before your parents-in-law appear. “Oh. Hello, Daring Do. You are here already?”\r\n\r\nDaring Do squinted even harder. She looked like a racist stereotype. “You kidnapped my assistant.”\r\n\r\n“And you bested my sister in a one-liner match,” Luna said, batting her bat-like wings and shrugging. She approached Daring Do ever-so-slightly, in an overly casual way, then looked at Celestia. “What did she say, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“She made a reference to the sun going down every night, and then assured me that my fate would be the same.”\r\n\r\n“Ooooh. Oh, that’s a good one. And you replied with…?”\r\n\r\nA moment of hesitation, and then Celestia looked to the side. “Um,” she said. “About that.”\r\n\r\nThere is a certain expression that’s almost impossible to describe. The face you make when your little sibling gets naked in front of your crush, or when your twin forgets your birthday.\r\n\r\nThat’s the face Princess Luna made at Celestia.\r\n\r\n“…You used the cup of tea line again, didn’t you.” \r\n\r\n“I—”\r\n\r\nLuna rubbed her temples. “It is noon. You could have just pointed out that it is noon, and so the sun is actually at its highest. This was [i]so easy.[/i] And you went with the cup of tea line anyway.”\r\n\r\n“I got stressed, and I could not think straight!”\r\n\r\n“Sigh.” Luna shook her head. “You know what that means.” A flash of her horn, and a rolled-up newspaper appeared right next to her face and floated towards Celestia. “This hurts me more than it hurts you, Sister.”\r\n\r\nCelestia didn’t falter. She faced death with dignity. “Must we?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“We must.” Luna shook her head, and her magical grip on the rolled-up newspaper tightened. “Sister?”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Do not use the cup of tea line.”\r\n\r\nAnd she whapped Celestia on the muzzle with the newspaper.\r\n\r\n“Ouch.” \r\n\r\n“Well then!” Luna turned around, happy face on again—it showed off her new fangs; she looked like a particularly cheery rabid dog—and made a doubtlessly friendly gesture towards Daring Do. “That being taken care of, Daring Do, we can just—”\r\n\r\n[i]WH-TCHK![/i]\r\n\r\nThe crack of the whip echoed across the room, and the rolled-up newspaper fell to the floor, neatly cut in two halves.\r\n\r\n“Enough games.” Daring Do jerked her head, and the whip came back to her. She talked through gritted teeth, the grip firmly secured in her mouth. “You kidnapped Sugar Song. [i]Tell me where she is.[/i]”\r\n\r\nLuna looked at the bisected newspaper, and let out a low whistle. “She is really attached to that mare, is she not?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Luna, you couldn’t imagine.” Celestia smiled while saying this; a warm gesture that had no place in such a dark room. “For Sugar Song, Daring Do would go to Tartarus and back. They have the most wonderful of friendships.” \r\n\r\n“Sister, that is really not the right reaction for a villain.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Sorry.” Celestia shook her head ever-so-slightly, and then she got up and walked away from her throne, towards Daring Do. There was no fear in her eyes, even after Daring brandished the whip. “I have kidnapped Sugar Song indeed, my dear Daring Do. I cannot tell you the reason—let’s just say, I’ve gone mad with power—but I can tell you that you will not rescue her today.”\r\n\r\nTension rose. The air felt strange, the room itself seemed to hold its breath. The silence was like the last few seconds before the thunderstorm strikes.\r\n\r\nLuna stepped aside as her sister walked by, but her eyes never left Daring Do. As for the daredevil herself, she merely gritted her teeth and opened her wings, muscles tensed like bow strings.\r\n\r\nBut Celestia didn’t mind it. She merely kept on walking on. “In fact,” she said, and her voice was sweet as sugar, old as wood, “I’m afraid you might never see her again.”\r\n\r\nLightning struck.\r\n\r\nMany things happened at the same time. A blur, a blink; Daring Do moved. She zigzagged and charged, headfirst, like an arrow being shot, fast, too fast for the eye—\r\n\r\nLuna was faster. “No,” she said.\r\n\r\nA flash of light.\r\n\r\nAnd Daring [i]fell,[/i] she didn’t trip, she [i]fell,[/i] hard, crashing against the floor, limbs sprawled in all directions—and she felt herself being pulled amidst the blinding pain, sliding across the room like the puck in a hockey game… \r\n\r\nAnd then something stopped her.\r\n\r\nA hoof.\r\n\r\nLuna was lightly stepping on her.\r\n\r\n“Sister, that was careless,” Luna said, though her tone was too light for the message. “You could have been hurt.”\r\n\r\n“You worry too much, Luna.” And Celestia walked by, never looking back, and she passed the doors, and—\r\n\r\nDaring yelled. “YOU DON’T GET TO RUN AWAY!” \r\n\r\n[i]WH-TCH—[/i]\r\n\r\n“No.” \r\n\r\nAnd the whip tensed and stopped. Luna’s horn was shining. She had grabbed it mid-lash. \r\n\r\n“The same trick will not work twice, I fear.” Luna pulled, and the whip came free from Daring Do’s teeth and flew across the room, like a snake’s carcass in a hurricane. “Although that was impressive! I did not know you could use a whip. I should read your books.”\r\n\r\nDaring Do growled more than talked. “Luna,” she said. “You, of all ponies?”\r\n\r\n“Well.” Luna frowned, and then looked at Daring Do—who was, by the way, still sprawled behind her hoof—with something like annoyance. “I will admit that I enjoy a more relaxed schedule than my sister, but I am still a princess. I have duties. I cannot just read everything that—”\r\n\r\n“This doesn’t make any sense already,” Daring said, ignoring the blabber. “Princess Celestia being a villain, a tyrant, it just… I can’t understand it. But [i]you?[/i]”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we are talking about [i]that[/i].”\r\n\r\n“After all you did, after all you went through, after all you promised… and you just betray Equestria like this, again.” Daring Do didn’t move. “I trusted you. I believed in your redemption when nopony else did. And it never mattered to you?”\r\n\r\nLuna blinked. Her face looked perfectly innocent. “There… seems to have been a misunderstanding, Daring Do. Who says I broke my promise?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“My redemption. It was not for this kingdom’s sake,” Luna said, with the voice used to explain the obvious. “It was for my sister. It was she whom I betrayed a thousand years ago, and she who forgave me for it. It is to her that I swore loyalty when I came back.”\r\n\r\nDaring Do said nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd Luna saw this, and smiled. “I only care for Celestia. Where she goes, I follow.” And she lowered her head and whispered into Daring’s ear. Her breath was hot and cold, her voice full of dark spice. “As far as I am concerned, Daring Do, [i]Equestria can burn.[/i]”\r\n\r\nAnd in that moment, Daring Do could hear the evil in her voice.\r\n\r\nShe couldn’t repress a shiver.\r\n\r\nAnd then she moved.\r\n\r\n[i]THUNK![/i]\r\n\r\n“Gggh!” Luna felt something cold and painful in her chest, and took a step back, tripped, fell. Daring Do was holding something against her. Something black, and long, and pointy. She felt the strength abandon her body, and her eyes widened in recognition. “…This,” she whispered with what was left of her voice. “Tirek’s horn. You…”\r\n\r\nDaring Do replied with a grim smirk. “Princess Celestia said it herself, didn’t she? [i]I’d go to Tartarus and back.[/i]”\r\n\r\nAnd that was the last thing Princess Luna heard before her magic was stolen away and everything went black.\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe click-clack of keys in the dark.\r\n\r\nSong’s ears perked up.\r\n\r\nSomepony was opening the door to her dungeon.\r\n\r\nHer body didn’t tense. There were many reasons for this—she’d been working with Daring Do so long that she knew to be relaxed when in danger—but  mostly it was because she was chained at the wall by the neck and, frankly, there were better ways to go out than ‘accidentally suffocating yourself’.\r\n\r\nWhispers, outside. Song couldn’t recognize the voices. They were too faint. \r\n\r\nSugar Song was a petite unicorn, light blue. She wore a pair of little red glasses. She looked like a schoolteacher who gave candy to the kids who broke down crying, and she’d been held chained to that wall for weeks, maybe even months. When everything was so dark, when you couldn’t see, time had no meaning.\r\n\r\nThe door opened.\r\n\r\nSong held her breath. \r\n\r\n“[i]Sugar![/i]”\r\n\r\nAnd the voice—the way the voice almost broke, like there were shards of glass in the speaker’s throat—hit her like a hammer, and the terror went away and for a moment she forgot about her shackles and tried to get up, and not even the sudden lack of oxygen made her go down. “[i]Daring![/i]” she yelled, and soul singers wished they could put as much emotion in her voice. “[i]Daring, in here![/i]”\r\n\r\n“Sugar!” the door opened completely, now, and suddenly there was light, and Sugar Song had to blink it away for a second. “Where?!”\r\n\r\nEverything was blurry. Song noticed she’d lost her glasses, and she hadn’t even noticed. “To your right!” she said. “In the corner!”\r\n\r\n“Sugar Song!” The sound of hoofsteps quick against the stone floor, and suddenly Daring Do was hugging Song, careful to do it against the wall so she wouldn’t choke against the shackles. “Oh, thank the stars. I was so worried, I was just…”\r\n\r\nPause. \r\n\r\nDaring Do blinked, unhugged Sugar Song, and took a step back. She coughed, covering her mouth with a hoof, and looked to the side. “Um. Glad to see you’re okay, Song.”\r\n\r\n“What?” Song felt like waking up from a dream. “Daring, what are you…”\r\n\r\nAnd then she saw the shadow of somepony else by the door.\r\n\r\n“Uh.” And Song shook her head, coughed, and talked with a much more professional voice. “I mean. You sure took your sweet time, Yearling.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know how it goes. Gotta save the world here and there, fight some monsters, can’t just spend all my free time saving my assistant.” Here, Daring looked at Sugar Song, dead in the eye. “You’re okay, though, right?”\r\n\r\nAnd Song didn’t nod, because her neck really hurt by now. “Yeah.”\r\n\r\n“They didn’t hurt you?” A look around, and then Daring looked at her with that kind of smirk that shaped her face in a way that cried out for a fist. “Do you know what’s happened in these few weeks? How Equestria’s doing? What the Tyrant is up to?”\r\n\r\nSong frowned. “No. They just…”\r\n\r\n“So,” Daring interrupted, “they just [i]kept you in the dark[/i].”\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n“Is it too late to ask that you don’t rescue me?”\r\n\r\n“Ship’s sailed, Song. I’m afraid I’m all you’ve got.”\r\n\r\nSong sighed. “You know what? My mother was right. I should’ve taken that job as a librarian.” She squinted. “Dream job, right there. Nary a pun. How long have you been planning that one?”\r\n\r\n“Ever since Princess Luna told me where they were keeping you, really.” \r\n\r\nThis got Sugar Song’s attention, and her ears perked up. “Princess Luna,” she said. “Princess Luna told you were I am?”\r\n\r\n“Hmm.” Daring Do produced a big, old-looking key from her saddlebags, and then started to work on Song’s shackles. “Had to force her a little. Princess?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, can I come in? I did not want to interrupt.” The door opened a little bit further, and the shadow standing in front of it came in—Princess Luna, Song could see now. Without glasses, her vision wasn’t perfect, but it’s not like she was blind. Luna looked different, now; she had fangs, her coat was darker, and her bat-like wings were…\r\n\r\n“…Tied up?” Song asked. “She’s—Yearling, did you tie up Princess Luna?” Another look. “With a [i]whip?[/i]”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t have rope.”\r\n\r\n“Does it look strange?” Luna tried to turn around to look at her own back, but in doing so, her back also turned around, because that’s how movement worked. “Daring Do told me it did not look strange, but I feel she is merely trying to avoid hurting my feelings.”\r\n\r\n“You… I mean, Yearling, those are some interesting knots you made there. Very elaborate. Doesn’t seem to cover all the important bits, though. Where did you learn to tie mares up like this, again?”\r\n\r\n“Best way to immobilize wings.” Daring’s voice was gruff. “I’m a pegasus. I know this stuff.”\r\n\r\n“Was the part around her flank needed for the wings, too?”\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact, yes.”\r\n\r\nLuna cocked her head to the side. “So it does look strange.”\r\n\r\n“Strange? Well, I wouldn’t say that much.” A [i]clack![/i] and the shackle around Sugar Song’s neck fell to the floor. She groaned in relief, then looked at Daring, who was now working on the shackles around her hooves. “It’s just… It looks like something Yearling wouldn’t write in one of her books out of fear of losing the PG rating,” Song said.\r\n\r\nDaring Do glared at her. “I had,” she said, clearly enunciating each and every word, “no rope. And I had to tie her up, or else she might have flown away. Don’t make this weird.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, R-rated books? Not what your usual audience expects, but I’ll admit they do sell well lately.” Now it was Song who had the punchable smirk on her face. “Two beautiful, defenseless mares, trapped in a dark dungeon with you, tied up, [i]only you have the key…[/i]”\r\n\r\nAnother [i]clack![/i], and Song was finally free. “Well, you’re not tied up anymore, so that’s one thing you got wrong.” She got up, tossed the key to the side—It fell to the ground with a heavy, metallic noise—and looked at Luna. “And I know you’re not stupid enough to think Luna is really defenseless.”\r\n\r\nSong just arched an eyebrow at this, and looked from Luna to Daring Do, who was wearing her best Angry Glare. “You never denied the ‘beautiful’ part.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, Song.”\r\n\r\nSong didn’t giggle, she was way too dignified for that, but she let a shameless grin get all the way up to her face. She accepted the new pair of glasses Daring Do handed her—oh, they were red too? Nice—and blinked in relief when everything became much clearer. “Thanks.”\r\n\r\n“You’re welcome.”\r\n\r\n“And good…” Song blinked, and looked at Daring. “Afternoon?” Daring nodded, so Song turned to Luna once more. “Afternoon, yes. Good afternoon, Your Highness. It seems like we’re enemies, now.”\r\n\r\nLuna beamed at her. “So we are!”\r\n\r\n“A shame.” And Song meant it. She did not let her voice show it, but her glare hardened. “I respected you, Your Highness. I thought we were friends. It seems like I was wrong.”\r\n\r\n“There is no need to be melancholic, Sugar Song,” Princess Luna said, standing tall in spite of the questionable ropes—whip—around her wings, and she looked majestic still. “After all we have been through, I believe there will always be a bond between us, no matter what.”\r\n\r\nSong shook her head. “Your Highness,” she said, “you betrayed Equestria. You and your sister became despots. Some things can’t be forgiven, even if—”\r\n\r\n“Remember when we saved Hearth’s Warming together?”\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n“Actually, I do. That was fun.” She thought about this. “You know, maybe I’m overreacting a little.” Song looked at Daring. “Are we overreacting, Yearling?”\r\n\r\n“They kidnapped you and kept you in a dungeon for weeks,” Daring said. “Also, they betrayed Equestria. Reign with an iron hoof.” She squinted. “They even got an obsidian throne. Completely black.”\r\n\r\n“…An obsidian throne?”\r\n\r\nLuna beamed again. “It was my idea!”\r\n\r\n“Wow. But, I mean.” Song sighed. “Yearling, Princess Luna [i]did[/i] help us save Hearth’s Warming. And I even rediscovered the true meaning of the festivity. You have to admit, that was a good adventure.”\r\n\r\nDaring Do didn’t relent. “It was fine.”\r\n\r\n“It was fun!” Luna said. “I have always remembered it fondly, Sugar Song.”\r\n\r\nSong looked at Luna, then at Daring. “Are we sure they’re evil?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Completely? She looks the part, but Princess Luna has always seemed rather… I don’t know. Childish? Maybe this is just a game to her.” A blink, and Song looked at the Princess. “No offense.”\r\n\r\n“None taken, Sugar Song.” Luna spoke slowly, savoring every word. “I take pride in my playfulness. An excessive emphasis on the serious side of my character is what brought my downfall on the first place.” \r\n\r\nAnd here, she smiled, in a way that could have been wise and understanding, were it not for the fangs. \r\n\r\nPause. Daring Do glared at Luna and made a beckoning gesture.\r\n\r\n“…That, and the raging urge to murder ponykind that swept over me,” Luna conceded with a nod. “I assumed that was a given.”\r\n\r\n“Just wanted to make sure, Princess.” Daring turned her back to her. “Song, can you use your magic?”\r\n\r\n“No.” This was the truth. There’d been a magic suppressor at the entrance to the dungeons—one of those doors that blocked your horns as you passed. “Not until we get out of here, at least.”\r\n\r\n“I see.” Daring buried her muzzle in her saddlebags, and then she took out—\r\n\r\n“…My rapier,” Sugar Song said, frowning slightly. “You brought my rapier?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Daring said through gritted teeth. She was holding the sword’s handle with her mouth. “Thought you’d need it. Take it and hold it against Luna’s neck. She might try to escape.”\r\n\r\nLuna was looking at the sword with inquisitive eyes. “Daring Do?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Were you carrying that sword the whole time?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Saddlebag.”\r\n\r\n“That sword is over a meter long.”\r\n\r\n“Really good saddlebag. Worth every bit.” Daring looked back at Song. “Song,” she urged. “She’s an alicorn. No matter how much I tie her up—”\r\n\r\n“And you tied her up pretty hard,” Song mused.\r\n\r\n“—she’s dangerous. The more careful we are, the safer we’ll be. So take the rapier. You’re better than me with it anyway.”\r\n\r\nSong frowned, and her ears went flat against her head. “I don’t know,” she said. “I mean, I know she’s an alicorn, but are you sure you aren’t just overreacting?”\r\n\r\nDaring Do arched an eyebrow, but it was Luna who answered. “I have no magic left,” she said. “Well, a little. Just enough to walk, speak a little. It is impossible for me to fly this way. I am borderline defenseless.”\r\n\r\n“Oh.” Song blinked. “Well, Yearling, see? She can’t really—”\r\n\r\n“So it would take me a full three seconds, I would bet,” Luna added.\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\nSong smiled sweetly. “Beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“Roughly, of course. I’ve seen you both in action, Sugar Song, and I know you’re capable enough in a fight.” Luna bowed at them, a sign of respect. Or maybe she was just checking out her own hooves. Even if that was the case, she did in a respectful way, at least. “But I believe, still, that I could crush you like a hazelnut if the need ever arose.”\r\n\r\nDaring Do looked at Sugar Song. Song didn’t look at her; she was too busy staring at Luna, sweet smile still showing. \r\n\r\nLuna seemed to notice the silence, and then she gave them the kind of look really big dogs give after being caught doing something naughty. It wasn’t as much apologetic as charismatic, in a ‘your throat is still in one piece just because I want it to’ sort of way. \r\n\r\n“But,” she said, “no offense.”\r\n\r\nAnd Daring and Song just looked at her.\r\n\r\n“Yearling?”\r\n\r\n“Song?”\r\n\r\n“Give me that sword.”\r\n\r\n“Atta girl.” Daring Do threw the rapier in the air, where it twirled twice—and Song gave her head a jerk and grabbed it expertly by the grip, eyes never truly leaving Luna. \r\n\r\nThen, Song pointed the sword straight at the Princess’ neck. “So what’s the plan?”\r\n\r\n“We get out of here. Get your magic back.” Daring Do’s eyes sparkled, and she showed her teeth. “Then, we find Queen Tyrant Celestia… and we make her pay.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey didn’t find Queen Tyrant Celestia.\r\n\r\n“We also did not make her pay, I must add,” Luna said after three hours of walking. “I do not know if you are aware, Daring Do.” \r\n\r\nDaring Do didn’t reply as much as she grunted in Luna’s general direction.\r\n\r\n“I will take that as a show of gratitude for my input,” Luna said. “And I am glad to see I was of service.” A little bit of spring—like the first week of March—made it to her step. “This is nice.”\r\n\r\nNeither Daring nor Song replied, because they weren’t in the mood.\r\n\r\n“I am such a good prisoner,” Luna continued.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Castle was a nightmare.\r\n\r\nThing is, Daring Do was good with mazes—she’d had a lot of practice with them during Ahuizotl’s labyrinthian phase—but that’s because mazes had a [i]structure.[/i] Even the best-designed maze has a pattern, because a maze is nothing but a riddle made into a building, and unless you’re a hack writer, every riddle has a solution. \r\n\r\nSo Daring Do would look for the patterns, the little details, the way the maze worked. She would [i]understand[/i] the maze, find the solution, dart out, and usually punch Ahuizotl right in his weird long face. \r\n\r\nThe Dark Castle, by the formal definition of the word, wasn’t a maze. It was just a mess.\r\n\r\nNothing made any sense whatsoever, and it was [i]painfully clear[/i] that this wasn’t due to the Tyrant trying to confound and intimidate her enemies, and was more the work of somepony who had no idea how buildings were supposed to work. \r\n\r\nMost corridors only turned left, even when the Castle quite clearly wanted them to go right. There were way too many doors in way too little places. Every curtain was drawn, never mind that most of the time they weren’t put in front of the windows at all. Now and then, an incredibly sturdy wall of perfectly transparent glass would stand in the middle of a room, always placed in such a way that Sugar Song would slam her face against it.\r\n\r\nEvery room and corridor tried to be more dark and gloomy than the previous—all skeletons and dark purple flames and chains and spikes. And this only added to the confusion, because everything was so over designed and individual it all looked [i]exactly the same[/i]. Extremes often touch each other; reality is shaped like a horseshoe that way.\r\n\r\n[i]TONK.[/i]\r\n\r\n“Argh!” Song didn’t drop her sword—it was still diligently pointed towards Luna’s neck at all times, although now it was held by magic alone—but she had to stop and rub her muzzle. “Oh, cookie dough,” she muttered, little tears forming on her eyes. “This is the fourth time that happened!”\r\n\r\nThey were in another corridor, now—black, purple, shades of red by their right; big news—and Daring was positively trembling with a mixture of excitement and absolute boredom. “You okay, Song?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“My muzzle hurts.” And Song punched the wall of glass. “Ouch. And my hoof.”\r\n\r\n“I recommend that you do not hit the crystal walls,” Luna said, leaning towards Song and ignoring the sword with the nerve of somepony who has outright forgotten there’s a scrap of metal threatening your life at all times. “That would help with the hurting.”\r\n\r\nSong squinted at Luna. “Thanks, Your Highness.”\r\n\r\n“I am here to help.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then you’re not helping hard enough,” Daring said, turning wholly towards Luna, brow furrowed. “Princess, we need to find your sister. I understand that you don’t want to betray her, but she has to answer for what she did.”\r\n\r\n“And I understand that.”\r\n\r\n“Then tell us where she is!” Daring said, stomping a hoof on the ground. “We’ve been trekking around this stupid place for hours—just bring us to the Tyrant!”\r\n\r\nLuna closed her eyes, and shook her head. “I cannot do that.”\r\n\r\nSong made a face. “We can make you talk,” she said, getting the sword even closer to Luna’s neck. Then, she gave this a little bit of thought. “I mean. Probably. If you’re nice about it. Please?”\r\n\r\nLuna chuckled, and looked at Song. “Oh, Sugar Song,” she said. “I cannot say no to such a polite request, least of all when it comes from you. We did save Hearth’s Warming together, after all.”\r\n\r\n“You’re awfully fond of that adventure,” Daring Do said.\r\n\r\n“It had always been a dream of mine to be the [i]hero[/i] in a seasonal tale. Makes for a welcome change.” Luna scratched her muzzle, seemingly lost in thought. “I assume it helped that I did not try to devour any children?”\r\n\r\nDaring Do nodded. “That’d do the trick, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Interesting. I shall remember that advice.”\r\n\r\n“Boy.” Sugar looked up and down at Luna. “The more I think about it, the more surprised I am at just how strongly I believed in your redemption, Your Highness.”\r\n\r\n“I have that effect on people,” Luna nodded. “I am charismatic.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was at that exact moment that someone tried to kill her.\r\n\r\nIn what was steadily starting to become a somewhat characteristic move on Princess Luna’s part, she did not flinch, or even try to dodge, when a sharp, pointy piece of metal approached her neck at sound-breaking speed. \r\n\r\nBut she was perfectly aware of it happening—and in fact, it was Luna’s eyes that Daring Do noticed; Luna’s eyes, suddenly darting to the left, and Daring Do [i]felt[/i] more than saw the sudden blur that came from the corner, she felt more than heard the sound of sharp metal piercing through the air and—\r\n\r\n[i]CLANG![/i]\r\n\r\nSong swatted the thing out of the air like a fly, and the projectile fell to the floor in a rather anticlimactic way. “Nope,” she said, her tone bored as she adjusted her little red glasses. “Not on my watch.”\r\n\r\nDaring Do was out like a shot before Song could even finish talking, flying towards the corner in a split moment—but there was nobody there.\r\n\r\n“You two have incredible reflexes,” Princess Luna mused, looking at Song’s sword (which was, once again, pointed against her neck). “I must congratulate you.”\r\n\r\n“Comes with the job,” Daring said, not really paying attention. The corridor was cast in shadows, of course it was, and the thing had come from the corn— “Actually,” and here Daring Do stopped looking for clues and looked back to Song and Luna, “what was that they threw? A dagger?”\r\n\r\nSong used her magic to prod the thing from the ground, then inspected it. “More like a scrap of metal, actually,” she said. “Aerodynamic. Made to be thrown.”\r\n\r\n“So like a dagger.”\r\n\r\n“Cheap knockoff, yeah.”\r\n\r\nDaring arched an eyebrow. “Would it have killed Princess Luna if you hadn’t swatted it out?”\r\n\r\nSong looked at the piece of metal, and then, without saying a word, she flicked her horn to the right and shot the thing against the wall in front of her. The [i]stone[/i] wall in front of her.\r\n\r\nWith a [i]thud![/i] the piece of metal got stuck. More than half of it was inside the wall now. The wall that was made, and this cannot be emphasized enough, exclusively out of stone. \r\n\r\nSo Song looked at this, and went “Yeah. Yeah, this would—this would have probably killed her. Your Highness?”\r\n\r\n“I believe it would have decapitated me quite efficiently, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm.” And Daring went back to inspect the corner. “Not so cheap, then, Song.”\r\n\r\nThe corridor turned to the left—Daring Do hated this Castle. She hated this Castle so much—but thanks to the stupid location of the window and some lucky curtains, the point where the two walls connected was completely dark. A perfect hiding place… only Daring was sure nopony had been there when they’d passed this spot less than a minute ago.\r\n\r\n“There must be some kind of passage, or secret door, or something,” Daring Do said after a couple minutes, finally coming back to where Song and Luna waited. “But I can’t find anything. The mechanism probably only opens from the inside.”\r\n\r\nSong frowned. “A one-way only secret passage? That sounds pretty useless for navigation.”\r\n\r\n“Handy for assassination, though,” Daring said. She took a look at Luna’s bindings—but they were still as tight as ever. “Which bears the question, Princess: what just happened?”\r\n\r\nLuna seemed to put some actual thought in her response. She was, if anything, a diligent prisoner. “Well,” she said. “I believe I almost underwent a murder, Daring Do.”\r\n\r\n“Sharp as usual, Princess.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you!”\r\n\r\n“The question here is [i]why,[/i] this just happened, Your Highness,” Song said, readjusting her little red glasses once more. She didn’t need to do it, but she liked how the gesture made her look smarter. “And who threw the… Yearling, are we calling it a dagger?”\r\n\r\n“We’re calling it a dagger.”\r\n\r\n“…And who threw the dagger at you, Princess,” Song finished. “Do you have any idea?”\r\n\r\nAnd Luna said, “I do not.”\r\n\r\nAnd Daring said, “I do.”\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\nSong arched an eyebrow. “Well, usually this goes the other way around. Yearling?”\r\n\r\n“It was the Tyrant,” Daring said. “Who else? She knew you’d stop the dagger. What I want to know is the why. I know she’s crazy, but there must be a reason for this.”\r\n\r\n“What?” Song’s eyes got wide. “Yearling, you must be joking. There’s no way Princess Celestia—”\r\n\r\n“[i]Queen Tyrant Celestia[/i],” Luna and Daring corrected at the same time.\r\n\r\n“She is sensitive about the title,” Luna added.\r\n\r\n“…Right. No way Queen Tyrant Celestia would endanger Princess Luna’s life.” A blink. “Wait, but you’re still just a Princess, Your Highness?”\r\n\r\n“I always thought princesses were prettier than queens,” Luna admitted. “It is always the queens that play the role of a villain in fairytales, are they not? I believed it would be better for my image to avoid such connotations.”\r\n\r\n“Uh.” Song frowned. “Your Highness, you [i]are[/i] a villain. You talked about eating children like five minutes ago.”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes. But I always found myself to be rather insecure of my identity, my dear Sugar Song.”\r\n\r\n“But you [i]do[/i] eat children, is what I’m getting at.”\r\n\r\n“Sugar Song,” Daring Do said, voice cold like a loveless marriage. “Would you mind not chit-chatting with our prisoner, the current second-most-evil villain in all of Equestria, please?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t a mare satisfy her curiosity now and then?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you do that [i]after[/i] we topple their regime?”\r\n\r\n“Hmmm.” Luna looked at them both, pensive expression on her face. “Personally,” she said, “I do not mind her inquiries, Daring Do.” Pause. “If that is what concerns you.”\r\n\r\n“…Yes. Yes, that’s what—you know what? You two just shoot the breeze over there, and I’ll be smart by myself over here.” Daring Do took a meaningful step to the side, and put a good two meters of distance between herself and the other two mares. “Good? Good. Now, I know [i]Princess[/i] Celestia well. I know she would never endanger Princess Luna’s life for the sake of one of her plans. But [i]Queen Tyrant[/i] Celestia? I can’t be so sure.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a good point, admittedly,” Song said. “Princess Celestia wouldn’t have kidnapped me either, I suppose. Still, I find this hard to believe.” She looked at Luna. “Your Highness? What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Song, you’re doing it again. You’re asking the megalomaniac villain for her opinion.”\r\n\r\n“I trust my sister with my life,” Luna said, sincerity in her voice. “I believe in her. I know she would never try to harm me, just as I would never raise a hoof against her.”\r\n\r\n“See, and now the megalomaniac villain is giving you her opinion, [i]and you’re actually listening.[/i]”\r\n\r\nSong nodded. “I think the same, Your Highness. You might have gone askew, but you and Princess—”\r\n\r\n“Queen Tyrant.”\r\n\r\n“—You and your sister share a wonderful bond.” She looked at Daring. “Yearling, I think she’s right. I trust her word.”\r\n\r\n“[i]Oh, come on![/i]”\r\n\r\n“What?” Song frowned and crossed her legs defensively. “Why are you so on edge today? Yearling, I know that Luna is our enemy, I’m not stupid, but she’s making a good point, and you know it! Did Celestia’s betrayal hurt you that much?”\r\n\r\n“This is not about Sister,” Luna whispered.\r\n\r\nAnd something in her voice made Song forget about Daring Do for a second and turn to her. “What?”\r\n\r\n“Daring Do is not hurt because my sister betrayed her trust,” Luna explained. “Or rather, she is… but that is not what troubles her. Tell me, Sugar Song: has Daring Do ever felt this angry before, when she is the one being kidnapped?”\r\n\r\nSugar thought about this. (“[i]Oh my goodness, stop listening to her![/i]”) “She hasn’t,” she said. “I mean, she only gets close to how she is now when I’m the one—”\r\n\r\n“When you are the one being kidnapped,” Luna finished. “Because Daring Do values your life more than hers. And I believe that, had she been the one we took, you would be hot with fury instead of her.” And there was a twinkle of something like love in her eye. “My sister and I are not the only ones who share a wonderful bond, Sugar Song.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Wow.” Sugar Song took a step back, and raised a hoof. “Wow, wow, wow. Back up, Your Highness. We’re not that—”\r\n\r\n“She’s just my assistant! You’re exaggerating!” Daring Do said, slightly louder than needed. “It’s just—well, a really good assistant, of course, best I’ve ever had, but it’s merely—”\r\n\r\n“—I mean I just work for her, really, there’s nothing else here, only that well you know how the economy goes and—”\r\n\r\n“—I’m not ‘hot with fury’ I’m merely, you know, trying to save the world, usual business, I mean I appreciate Sugar Song but we’re really—”\r\n\r\n“—not sharing a wonderful bond of any sorts,” Sugar Song finished.\r\n\r\n“—we’re just being professionals,” Daring Do added.\r\n\r\nAnd Luna looked at them with something that might have been appreciation, or it might have been mockery, but was most probably just a perfect mixture between the two. “I wish I had spent more time with you two before I became a villain again,” she said. “You are great company, Sugar Song, Daring Do.”\r\n\r\nDaring grimaced, and she finally started walking down the corridor again—they’d been standing in there for what felt like centuries. The others followed. “Well, Princess,” she said. “That’s something you should have thought of before actually turning back to evil, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you even do that, Your Highness?” Song asked, as they went back to the steady pace from before. They turned left when they met the end of the corridor. Daring Do cursed under her breath. Song ignored her. “You never actually explained it.”\r\n\r\n“Where my sister goes, I follow,” Luna said. “There’s nothing else to it.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, then why did Queen Tyrant Celestia go evil?”\r\n\r\n“Oh.” Luna shook her head. “I do not know myself.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nEven Daring Do turned around and looked at her at this. “…Seriously?” she asked.\r\n\r\nAnd Luna nodded. “Indeed. Of course, there are many possible reasons—my sister shoulders a great responsibility, Daring Do. It is easy to crack under the pressure, especially when you do not feel recognized.” A grimace. “I know that better than most.”\r\n\r\n“How on Equestria was Princess Celestia not appreciated?” Song wondered. “She was loved by everypony!”\r\n\r\n“And yet, her enemies vastly outmatched her allies,” Luna said. She did not sound chipper or child-like, now. There was venom in her voice. “Political leeches. Ungrateful aides. Power-hungry nobles, ponies who believe there is no place for an immortal rule in a kingdom made by mortals. Outside forces, entire races lusting after Equestria’s splendor.” She closed her eyes. “And my sister always turned the other cheek. I do not blame her, if she chose to put an end to all of it on her own hooves.”\r\n\r\nSong remained silent for almost fifteen seconds, trying to take it all in. “Wow,” she finally said. “I never knew about this. I mean, it doesn’t excuse evil, but I suppose…”\r\n\r\n“You never knew about this,” Daring interrupted, “because chances are, it wasn’t that bad. Princess Celestia was beloved, respected. Nopony would ever raise a hoof against her.”\r\n\r\n“Would they not?” Luna asked, eyebrow perfectly arched. “Would they not, Daring Do? That flying dagger was not the first attempt against my life, and it won’t be the last—and my sister has more experience than me when it comes to these situations. She has been poisoned enough times to learn to boil her own tea herself.”\r\n\r\nSilence. Neither Daring nor Song felt like saying anything. Luna’s words had been heavy enough to shut their mouths.\r\n\r\n“…Which is, I must add, a shame,” Luna said. “As she has the most horrible taste. Seriously, [i]chamomile tea.[/i]”\r\n\r\nDaring made a face despite herself. “Eugh. Really?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid such is the case, yes.”\r\n\r\n“That’s disgusting. Stuff tastes like lava.”\r\n\r\n“…So,” Song said, slightly annoyed. “Just because she—”\r\n\r\n“Song.” Daring Do glared at her. “I know it’s your favorite, but you have to admit that chamomile tea is—”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t talking about that,” Song said. Pause. “Well. A little. Just—her enemies turned Queen Tyrant Celestia into what she is?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, hey, you remembered the title this time.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I’m trying to make an effort.”\r\n\r\n“I believe that is the most rational explanation, yes,” Luna said, nodding gravely. Then, she shrugged, this time far less gravely. “Or it could just be the sewers, really. There is simply no way to know.”\r\n\r\nYou simply cannot be a bona fide explorer—the kind that wears that weird hat, the kind that carries a whip around and makes it look imposing instead of ridiculous—without being used to surprises. Daring Do could see an entire cave turn into jelly beans, and she would take less than a second to react, because she was simply not one to be dumbfounded.\r\n\r\nBut then again, there were magical jellybeans, and then there were sewers being the root of all evil. For the first time in what felt like at least twelve years, Sugar Song saw Daring do a double take.\r\n\r\n“The se—what?” Daring Do shook her head. “What? The sewers?”\r\n\r\nAnd Luna’s mouth became a thin hard line. “The sewers,” she said—and again, venom in her voice, although a little less than earlier. “The changeling invasion destroyed the sewers under Canterlot, and we [i]still[/i] have not fixed them. Half the tunnels are blocked nowadays, using magic is dangerous when the tunnels are so full of crystals, and the smell is just terrible. There is [i]a lot[/i] of paperwork when it comes to the sewers, every day.”\r\n\r\nThe corridor turned left—cue Daring cursing loudly—and it led them to a door, which led them to a gigantic room. They went in.\r\n\r\nSong looked at Luna. “…And that justifies turning evil?”\r\n\r\n“Any measure is justified, no matter how drastic it is, if it frees us from the shackles of bureaucracy,” Luna said.  \r\n\r\n“I feel like you’re somewhat projecting when you say that, Your Highness.”\r\n\r\n“I might accept that my moral code is a thousand years outdated, Sugar Song, and I will make an effort to learn your new ways, [i]but in some places I draw the line[/i].”\r\n\r\n“Well, if we ever find her, we can ask the Queen Tyrant herself what made her start oppressing her subjects like she does, I suppose,” Daring said, glaring at Luna. “You still refuse to tell us where she is, Princess?”\r\n\r\nLuna thought about this, then looked at Daring Do. “I believe I can actually tell you now, Daring Do.”\r\n\r\n“What?!”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Luna pointed. “She is right behind you.”\r\n\r\nThey all turned around.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room stood Queen Tyrant Celestia.\r\n\r\nShe looked tall and royal. There was little light around them, but the dark jewels around her neck glistened like cockroaches—in a good way, if such a thing is possible—and the red-blood crown on top of her head was, in all honestly, quite tacky.\r\n\r\nBut she still pulled it off.\r\n\r\nShe looked [i]that[/i] royal, really. \r\n\r\nDaring Do and the Queen Tyrant locked eyes, almost involuntarily; such is the magnetism heroes and villains effect on each other. A final confrontation, if done well, will make any compass worth its salt go completely crazy.\r\n\r\n“Tyrant,” Daring Do spat. Behind her, Sugar Song tensed, and redoubled her concentration on the rapier. Daring saw this, and acknowledged it by making no gesture or comment whatsoever—Song would get it. “Finally.”\r\n\r\n“Daring Do,” Celestia said, voice levelled. “I see you’ve captured my sister.”\r\n\r\n“So I have.” Daring Do let out a terrible smirk, and for a second, [i]she[/i] was the one who looked like a villain. “And now that the night is off the board, [i]it is time to take the Queen.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear Daring Do.” And Celestia chuckled sweetly. “I’m afraid that is [i]not my cup of tea.[/i]”\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n“Wait. Wait, that didn’t—”\r\n\r\n“[i]Goodness gracious Sister just call her a pawn.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry, Luna, it’s just—” Celestia sighed. “I am not good at this.”\r\n\r\n“[i]I cannot believe this.[/i]”\r\n\r\nSong arched an eyebrow. “I get the feeling there’s a story behind this.”\r\n\r\n“There is,” Daring said, and then she tensed. “But this is no time for tales.”\r\n\r\nAnd then she jumped.\r\n\r\nWith Sugar Song holding the sword—and, some would argue, the spotlight—not enough emphasis has been made on Daring Do’s speed. This is a mistake that many villains have made in the past, and that’s pretty much the main reason why Equestria still exists.\r\n\r\nDaring Do could move faster than a cobra strikes. Daring Do looked younger than she actually was, not because of genetics, but because of relativity. She had famously raced a laser, once, and while nopony had been there to witness the result—Daring Do was still here, and the laser was not.\r\n\r\nSo it is [i]not[/i] a small thing when it’s explained, here, that Daring Do moved as fast as she could, jumped as fast as she could, towards Celestia.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t even a blur, because you can see a blur. It was like lightning – now it’s here, now it’s gone.\r\n\r\nCelestia, alicorn as she was, powerful as she was, never had the time to dodge.\r\n\r\nNot like she needed to.\r\n\r\n[i]TONK![/i]\r\n\r\n“[i]ARGH. MY MUZZLE.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“A-hah! See? See? I told you!” Song stomped a hoof on the floor and pointed angrily at the space between them and Celestia. “Those stupid glass walls—I hate them so much!”\r\n\r\n“[i]I THINK I’VE BROKEN SOMETHING.[/i]”\r\n\r\nSong stopped looking at the glass, and turned towards Daring. “Gosh,” she said. “Are you okay?”\r\n\r\n“[i]I’M IN AGONY.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, but are you okay?”\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to fight, Daring Do,” Celestia said, ignoring the fact that Daring Do was currently squirming on the ground, trying to remember what being not in pain was like. “I only came here to talk.” Then, she nodded at Sugar Song. “I see you rescued your assistant, in spite of my words.”\r\n\r\n“[i]I HATE YOU.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“And I understand that,” Celestia said. “Such is, I believe, the fate of heroes and villains like us. To hate each other, no matter what.”\r\n\r\n“I think this is more about the whole invisible wall trick you just pulled on her, Your Majesty,” Song mused.\r\n\r\n“Oh.” Celestia blinked. “Is it?”\r\n\r\n“[i]IT IS.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind my words then.” Celestia shook her head. “As I said, I came here to talk… and to check on Luna. I’m afraid I must leave soon—important business awaits me, and the minotaurs are not patient.”\r\n\r\nLuna shot Celesta a half-smile. “I am sorry, Sister. I could not avoid being captured. Daring Do is a resourceful mare.”\r\n\r\nAnd Celestia nodded. “I know. And I am sorry, but—um.” She blinked. “Luna?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sister?”\r\n\r\n“Why are you tied up like that?”\r\n\r\n“I am a prisoner!” Luna explained, smiling perhaps a little bit too enthusiastically. “So Daring Do tied me up with her whip!” She turned around slightly, to show her full profile to Celestia, and then the smile wavered slightly. “It… looks bad, I take?”\r\n\r\n“What?” Celestia pressed a hoof against her chest. “Oh. Oh, no, I—I mean, I wouldn’t say it looks… bad, Luna. While I do not consider myself an expert on… the subject at hand, you [i]are[/i] a beautiful mare.”\r\n\r\nLuna’s smile went back to normal. “Thank you!”\r\n\r\n“However, I am your sister, and as such I find it highly uncomfortable to discuss such details.” Celestia frowned. “And I would appreciate it if you kept this kind of activity to a more, hm, private environment, Daring Do.”\r\n\r\n“[i]ARE YOU KIDDING ME.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“Yearling,” Song said, looking sternly at Daring, “if even the Queen Tyrant agrees that this looks questionable, maybe the one at fault here is you. Just saying.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind your attire, Luna. I know you suffered an attack recently.” Celestia looked at her sister with longing. “For them to attack you directly, in the open, like that… They’re growing bolder, abandoning subterfuge. Whoever they are. I hope that you are unharmed?”\r\n\r\nLuna nodded. “I am.”\r\n\r\nAnd Celestia let out a sigh, and her shoulders relaxed. “Oh,” she said, “thank the stars. I—I am sorry, Luna. I cannot rescue you yet.” She swallowed. “But I will.”\r\n\r\n“Of that I have no doubts, Sister.”\r\n\r\n“Do not tell them where I am.”\r\n\r\n“I will not.”\r\n\r\nCelestia nodded, and looked at Song. “Sugar Song,” she said—Daring was still screaming on the floor, but they all wordlessly chose to ignore her for the time being— “I do not blame you for capturing my sister, especially after we kidnapped you. And I apologize for that; I did not wish to do such a thing, but I saw myself with no other option. However, I hope you understand…”\r\n\r\nSong raised a hoof, and Celestia stopped. “You will try to take back Luna,” Song said.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And I hope you understand, Your Majesty,” Song said, “that we [i]will[/i] take you down.”\r\n\r\nCelestia smiled at this. Her eyes were laughing. “You will try,” she said. \r\n\r\nAnd she left, walking slowly. And she never looked back.\r\n\r\nSong and Luna looked at her till she was gone, and then Song sighed, and looked down at Daring. “Yearling,” she said. “Are you done?”\r\n\r\nDaring Do woke up, still rubbing her muzzle. The corners of her eyes were wet, and she was a little red, but her face was determined once again. “Yeah,” she said. “I am. You called her ‘Majesty’?”\r\n\r\n“She’s a queen now,” Song replied, shrugging. “Do you think we can dismiss her throwing the dagger at Luna? She sounded honest.”\r\n\r\n“They always sound honest, Song,” Daring replied. Her voice was grim like the reaper itself. “That’s why they’re dangerous. Did you hear what she said?”\r\n\r\n“Minotaurs.” Song looked around. “In a maze. Fitting.”\r\n\r\n“This isn’t a maze, but I get you. Remind me to work that reference somewhere when I write the book, it’ll make me sound smarter.” \r\n\r\n“You’re such an artist sometimes, Yearling. You put so much thought into your work.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, Song.” Daring looked at Luna, eyebrow arched. “You mentioned the minotaurs, too, way back in the Throne Room.”\r\n\r\nSong blinked. “She did?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Before I got to you.” Daring was still looking at Luna. “Princess, seeing how easily Celestia found us, I assume you and her can locate each other with ease?”\r\n\r\nLuna nodded. “Indeed.”\r\n\r\n“But you won’t tell us where she is.”\r\n\r\n“My sister asked me, specifically, to not do that.” Luna looked at Daring with a look that was as sincere as it was defenseless. “I am afraid you know what my stance is.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm.” Daring Do nodded to herself, rubbed her muzzle a little bit more. “But what if I asked you—and I only do this because I know you’re a great prisoner, mind you—to tell us where the minotaurs are?”\r\n\r\nSong smiled at this, and elbowed Daring. “Loopholes, [i]and[/i] emotional manipulation? Somepony’s getting serious.”\r\n\r\n“Song, it stops being effective if you point it out.”\r\n\r\n“No, no.” Luna shook her head, and both mares’ attention was suddenly on her. “It worked nonetheless. My sister did not forbid me to tell you this, and we villains are famously obsessed with loopholes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh.” Song blinked, then looked at Daring. “Well. That’s a relief.”\r\n\r\nDaring gave Song a strained smile. “It’s really not.”\r\n\r\n“What? Why?”\r\n\r\n“How much do you know about minotaurs, Song?”\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\nA minotaur is, essentially, a bull with opposable thumbs. If this description alone is not enough to fill you with terror, then you have never met a bull.\r\n\r\n“What is this?!” The room was positively gigantic, bigger than even the Throne Room (which was obscene enough as it was) and yet the Minotaur King made it feel crowded with his voice alone. “You’re not the Queen! We’re forced to wait for hours, and this is the sorry escort that welcomes us?!”\r\n\r\n“I am a princess,” Luna pointed out.\r\n\r\n“Bah! Bah!” The Minotaur King—of the Cowliphate, if you will—made a dismissive gesture with his huge hairy hands. “Princesses! Barely worth the time! Prettier than queens, but hardly ever adequate villains!”\r\n\r\nAnd Luna made a gesture that, in another universe, in another dimension, would have been a fistpump. \"Yesssss.\" \r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King was huge, and built like a brick house. His pectorals alone stood taller than Princess Luna’s head, and his entire body was covered in thick black fur that looked hard enough to block arrows. His nostrils were the size of apples. His horns were harder, larger, and sharper than that of even an alicorn.\r\n\r\nAnd between them sat a twisted, vaguely crown-shaped chunk of metal. \r\n\r\nAround him stood his escort. His wife, the Minotaur Queen, was wearing a smaller chunk of crown-shaped metal. Toddling around was the Royal Baby—an adorable little calf who already had enough muscle to bench-press an elephant—and finally, six Minotaur Guards that didn’t so much skip leg day as devour it for the protein. \r\n\r\nMinotaurs are the reason the term “beast” has bad connotations, and there were [i]nine[/i] of them in the room. This didn’t spell trouble as much as it wrote it in the sky with flaming letters.\r\n\r\n“If you dare to make a ‘nine-o-taur’ pun, Yearling,” Song whispered, “I can’t be held responsible for my actions.”\r\n\r\n“So. You’re asking me if I’m [i]Daring[/i] enough.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to set fire to your house.”\r\n\r\n“I never liked minotaurs to begin with, and this one is famous for being boisterous.” Daring Do thoroughly ignored Song, and just squinted at the Minotaur King, whose eyes were two tiny red dots a blink away from total rage. “They say he’s a dangerous monster, and I believe it. He’s imposing. Has a dangerous minotaura.”\r\n\r\n“[i]You’ve got to be kidding me.[/i]”\r\n\r\n“But are you seeing what I’m seeing?” Daring pointed. “Over there?”\r\n\r\nSong rolled her eyes, then looked.\r\n\r\nAnd her eyes got wide.\r\n\r\n“Oh.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” Then Daring took a deep breath, and punched Song’s shoulder. “Wish me luck, Song.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll need it.” But Song punched Daring’s shoulder back, and there was an astounding amount of love in that gesture. “Be careful, Yearling.”\r\n\r\nDaring nodded, and then she raised her voice. “Minotaur King!” she said, and she walked towards the gigantic beast, head held high, no fear in her eyes. “We don’t come here in the Queen Tyrant’s name!”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” The Minotaur King glared—he couldn’t look; he could only glare, really—at Daring, and showed off his teeth in a snarl that would have steam-boiled an iceberg, gigantic nostrils flaring. “Bah! I do not care, then! I will only listen to the Queen!”\r\n\r\nDaring Do nodded. “Your lands, your minutareas, have never held friendly relationships with Equestria. I take the Queen Tyrant’s new politics have changed this?”\r\n\r\n“Bah! New politics? Bah!” And he waved his huge hairy hands in a dismissive way. Such a dismissive way, in fact, that he almost sent his own kid flying; the Royal Baby had been aimlessly walking around the Minotaur King’s legs for a while. “She has done nothing but change her title! We will not abide to such a weak policy!”\r\n\r\n“Aaaw.” By Song’s side, Luna pressed both hooves against her chest, eyes sparkling. “Look at that baby. It is adorable, is it not, Sugar Song?”\r\n\r\n“What?” Song looked at her, then at the Royal Baby. It was cute, she guessed, if you were into triceps. “Uh. Maybe?”\r\n\r\n“Who is a cute baby?” And Luna kneeled down and lifted up the Royal Baby then cradled it up in her arms. The thing liked it: it tried to grab her mane, giggling with a voice that was deeper than the ocean. “You are a cute baby, if I say so, yes you are. Oh, I could just gobble you up, yes I could.”\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n“…Your Highness.”\r\n\r\n“It is merely a figure of speech, Sugar Song.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, it better.”\r\n\r\n“She calls herself the Queen Tyrant,” the Minotaur King was yelling at the moment, “but she does not oppress her subjects! She does not kill her enemies! She just changed her castle!”\r\n\r\nDaring Do made a face. “She kidnapped my assistant, if that’s something to you.”\r\n\r\n“Hah! HAH!” The Minotaur King slapped one knee. His gigantic nostrils flared again anyway. “That is not something to me! I do not care for your assistant, and to be honest I don’t even know who you are! Neither do I care!” He snarled once again. “The Queen failed to impress us! This means [b]war![/b]”\r\n\r\nAll the other minotaurs roared enthusiastically behind the King. \r\n\r\nDaring Do just blinked. “Uh-huh.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem to be impressed!”\r\n\r\n“Nah, I’m really not.” Daring Do pointed at the Minotaur Queen. “However, that mini-tiara on your wife’s head reminded me of something, Minotaur King.” She buried her muzzle in her saddlebag, and produced the ‘dagger’ that had been thrown at Luna. “This was used,” she said, “to try to decapitate Princess Luna. Don’t you think it looks famil—”\r\n\r\n“Bah! Bah! I do not care for daggers!” And the Minotaur King slapped the dagger away from Daring’s hoof. \r\n\r\nIt flew across the room.\r\n\r\n[i]BLAM![/i]\r\n\r\nAnd then it hit the wall at the other side. \r\n\r\nDaring said nothing. She just stared at the dust at the other side of the room. The wall had been pretty much pulverized.\r\n\r\n“Princess Luna’s strength has been lauded across my lands!” the Minotaur King was yelling now. “No weapon would pierce her! Do not lie to me!”\r\n\r\n“Uh…” As in a daze, Daring Do went back to her saddlebag and took Tirek’s horn out. “Nnno, I’m not lying. I just used this horn to—”\r\n\r\n“Bah! Bah! I do not care for horns!” And the Minotaur King slapped the horn away from Daring’s hoof. \r\n\r\nIt flew across the room.\r\n\r\n[i]BLAM![/i]\r\n\r\nAnd it hit the wall at the other side. Exactly on the same spot the dagger had hit, too.\r\n\r\nSilence. \r\n\r\nThen Luna took a step forward and presented the little calf to the Minotaur King. “Here, take this baby.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! I do not care for babies!” And the Minotaur King slapped the—\r\n\r\n“Nooooo nononono. No.” Sugar Song pushed Luna—and the Royal Baby—away from the Minotaur King. “No infanticide, not on my watch.”\r\n\r\n“Aaaw.” Luna made a pout. “You are not fun, Sugar Song.” \r\n\r\n“Bah!” the Minotaur King yelled. “It is said that Princess Luna is strong! Stronger than you!” Nostrils flaring; nothing new under the sun. “I do not smile upon lies! I do not smile upon [i]anything![/i]” And he glared. “And who are you, to talk with me, and what are you doing here?!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, blast it. Might as well go all-in,” Daring muttered. “Minotaur King! My name is Daring Do!” And she stuck chest out (trying not to think on how much her hoof hurt because of the slaps) and yelled. “I assume you’ve heard about me!”\r\n\r\nThis made the Minotaur King stop and stare, mouth wide-open. And, for a beautiful second, he stopped yelling.\r\n\r\nThen the moment passed.\r\n\r\n“Yes! Yes!” The Minotaur King stomped on the ground enthusiastically. “I do know your name! You are a hero! A world-famous one!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I am,” Daring Do said, nodding. “I came here to save Equestria, as you might have guessed already. We seem to have common interests, Minotaur King. Perhaps we could help each other. The Queen Tyrant…”\r\n\r\n“Is a bigger threat than we thought!” the Minotaur King said.\r\n\r\n“Yeah!” Daring grinned. “Exactly!”\r\n\r\n“To be hunted by Daring Do! That is a sign of worthiness! If she had killed you, she might have earned my respect!”\r\n\r\n“Yeah!” Daring grinned even harder. “Exac—what.”\r\n\r\n“But she failed! She came out short!” The Minotaur King snarled again. Behind him, the guards and the Queen tensed. “We deal with heroes in my lands, Daring Do! We kill them! We’re worthy!”\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\nSong looked at Daring, squinting slightly. “Sorry, I think I don’t quite—was that a threat?”\r\n\r\nDaring nodded. “It was.”\r\n\r\n“Should we worry?”\r\n\r\n“I mean…?”\r\n\r\nAnd Luna looked at them both, and then looked at the Royal Baby. “I do think,” she said, “we are in trouble, baby.”\r\n\r\nThe Royal Baby blew a raspberry at Luna.\r\n\r\nAnd, as on cue, the Minotaur King let out a bloodcurdling roar and charged at them, horns-first.\r\n\r\nForce equals mass times acceleration. This means that if a really big, really strong musclehead with murderous intent charges at you, he will soon be unstoppable—but during the first few seconds, he’ll be a slow, dumb mass of murder made flesh. This meant that Daring Do, who was right in front of the Minotaur King, had more than enough time to dodge.\r\n\r\nThis also meant that Sugar Song, who was fairly behind them both, was pretty much screwed.\r\n\r\n“SONG! NO!”\r\n\r\nToo late for Daring to do anything, Song noticed what was happening with barely half a second to spare. More out of reflex than anything else, she pushed Luna to the side to keep her safe and sidestepped herself—\r\n\r\nBut the Minotaur King was expecting it. He stopped dead in his tracks—the floor creaked under the sudden pressure—and swung his head at her, horns glistening deadly…\r\n\r\n[i]Cling![/i]\r\n\r\nAnd Song parried them with her sword. “Ah-hah!” she yelled. “You won’t get me that easil—”\r\n\r\n[i]CLANG![/i]\r\n\r\nThe rapier went flying.\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\nSong’s voice sounded strangely calm. “Well, I’m dead.”\r\n\r\n“SONG!” Daring darted towards them. “GET DOWN! GET DOWN!”\r\n\r\nBut there was no time. The Minotaur King swung his head again, horns aiming straight towards Song’s chest—\r\n\r\n[i]CLING![/i]\r\n\r\nAnd Luna stepped right in front of Song, quick as lightning, and blocked the Minotaur King with the only hard enough thing.\r\n\r\nNot her own horn.\r\n\r\n[b]But the Royal Baby’s.[/b]\r\n\r\n“I love children,” Luna mused, cheeky smile on her face. “They are so useful!”\r\n\r\n“SONG! GET [i]DOWN[/i] I SAID!”\r\n\r\n“I—Yearling, did the Princess just parry the Minotaur King with a [i]baby?[/i]”\r\n\r\n“[i][b]GET DOWN![/b][/i]”\r\n\r\nSugar Song threw herself to the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s when Daring Do made it there, and punched the Minotaur King in the face.\r\n\r\nHe toppled backwards, like an ancient tower going down under a hailstorm. The other minotaurs roared.\r\n\r\nDaring Do grabbed the Royal Baby and threw it at them, horns-first, javelin style. Still down, the Minotaur King roared. Behind him, his escort stumbled and tripped on the flying calf.\r\n\r\nDaring turned towards the door. “RUN!”\r\n\r\nThey ran.\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only good thing about being chased in deadly convoluted buildings is that it should be extremely easy to lose your persecutors.\r\n\r\n[i]Should.[/i]\r\n\r\n“I hate this place!” Daring yelled as she flew by, wind roaring like thunder in her ears, yet not loud enough to drown the sound of nine minotaurs screaming bloody murder not far away from them. “I hate this place, I hate this place, I hate this place!”\r\n\r\n“Why are they so good at following us?!” Song screamed. She was being carried by Daring Do, because there was no way she’d have been able to run this fast. “How are they still behind us?!”\r\n\r\n“The Minotaur King has an amazing sense of smell,” Luna stated calmly, gracefully gliding right next to them. “He is probably following us by our scent, Sugar Song.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, right. Yeah, he had huge nostrils, didn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“I hate this place!” Daring Do shot a wild look at Luna. “And how are you flying?! Where’s my whip?!”\r\n\r\n“I took it off.” Luna closed her eyes apologetically. “I did not think I could fly with it.”\r\n\r\n“But I took your magic!”\r\n\r\nLuna shrugged. “The Minotaur King broke Tirek’s horn. I got it back.”\r\n\r\nSong readjusted her glasses. They were flying at top speed, so the gesture was needed, for once. “But you didn’t escape. And you saved my life, too.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I [i]am[/i] your prisoner.”\r\n\r\nBehind them, the minotaurs roared again. They sounded closer. Daring gritted her teeth and tried to fly a little faster.\r\n\r\n“Yearling.” Song’s voice was heavy. “I’m slowing you down. Maybe you should—”\r\n\r\n“No. Shut up.” Daring gritted her teeth even harder. “Scent. Scent, scent, scent, they follow our scent, how do we get them out, how do we lose—[i]Princess![/i]”\r\n\r\nLuna almost flinched. “Yes?”\r\n\r\n“The sewers! You said the smell was horrible! Would it be enough to cover our scent?”\r\n\r\nLuna thought about this. “…Yes,” she said. “Yes, I believe it would.”\r\n\r\n“THEN GET US THERE [i]RIGHT NOW![/i]”\r\n\r\nSo Luna shot a burst of magic at the floor beneath them.\r\n\r\nThe effect was immediate. There was almost no sound—the floor didn’t explode; it merely turned to dust—but there was a blinding light, and for a moment they stopped in their tracks almost immediately. There was a sudden pull, as the air got sucked into the empty space that had been occupied by a ton of rock and stone.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the smell.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t waste time talking. The minotaurs were too close. They just jumped right in, and flew into the sewers. There was almost no light down there.\r\n\r\nStressful minutes followed.\r\n\r\nThey flew by in random directions, trying their hardest to get lost. They turned right—Daring let out a wordless triumphant yell—a thousand times, went up, went down.  Half the corridors were dead ends. The sewers were more a network of caves than anything: the walls felt naturally grown, full of crystals and little gems, and only the doors and passageways were carved.\r\n\r\nBut if anything, that only made the destruction more apparent. Entire sections were impossible to traverse, huge chunks of debris blocking the way, forcing them to go around or even go back. It felt like a bomb had gone off down there.\r\n\r\nThe minotaurs didn’t seem to have this problem—they merely powered through every single wall, creating a passageway if there was none.\r\n\r\nBut at last, finally, they lost them. \r\n\r\n“They’re going the wrong way,” Daring said when they finally let themselves stop. They were panting slightly. “I heard them tear down a wall somewhere to the right—we’ve lost them. The smell [i]did[/i] help us.”\r\n\r\nSong swallowed, and frowned. “Yearling.” \r\n\r\n“I know.” And Daring’s frown darkened. “Trust me, I’ve noticed.”\r\n\r\n“What?” Princess Luna looked at them, confused. Then, she blinked. “Ah. Of course.” She closed her eyes, her horn flashed…\r\n\r\nSong’s ears perked up. “Oh,” she said. “Oh!” And she grabbed her rapier, which Luna had just invoked in front of her. “Thank you, Your Highness!”\r\n\r\n“You are welcome.” Another flash. “Daring Do, here is your whip.”\r\n\r\n“Hey. Pretty sweet of you, Princess. Wasn’t expecting that.” Daring grabbed the whip, and eyed Luna. “…Want me to tie you up again?”\r\n\r\nSong gave her a strange look, almost smug. “Oh, you’re asking for [i]consent[/i] now. You’re such a wonderful lover.”\r\n\r\nDaring glared. “Why did I rescue you, again?”\r\n\r\nLuna looked at them both and let out a heartfelt chuckle—which soon turned into a small cough fit. Once it passed, she wrinkled her muzzle. “Ugh,” she said. “The smell got worse. I still remember my time, when sewers were not yet a thing—and I cannot help but think it was a better method.”\r\n\r\nThis caught Daring Do’s attention. “It got worse, you said? Princess, did the sewers always smell like this?”\r\n\r\n“What?” Luna cocked her head to the side. “Of course they did. Was it not for this reason that we came down here on the first place?”\r\n\r\nDaring Do said nothing. She just looked at Song.\r\n\r\nSong nodded. “Your Highness,” she said. “We were not talking about my rapier before. What we noticed is… this is not the smell of sewage.” She pointed at the canal in front of them—the one that should have been carrying waste. “The sewers are completely dry.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed.” Daring Do’s eyes were fiery once more. “I think we might have found whoever threw that dagger at you, Princess. There’s more things happening in this place than we thought. Because, this?” And she took a deep breath. “[i]This is the smell of gunpowder.[/i]”\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Castle had defeated Daring Do with its mindless nonsense, but the sewers had been built to make sense. If every labyrinth is a riddle, then she solved this one with haste.\r\n\r\nThe smell got stronger and stronger as they got closer to the center. “We’re approaching where the Throne Room is,” Daring mused. “Or at least where it [i]was[/i], in the old castle. I don’t know about this one.”\r\n\r\n“We kept it in the same place,” Luna said. “Because it was, I believe, a hassle to do otherwise.”\r\n\r\nSong shrugged. “Convenient. So, gunpowder under the throne?”\r\n\r\n“And daggers thrown at the Princess,” Daring added. In the distance, they heard the minotaurs breaking another wall. They were closer than before—but they kept walking. “I think we’re dealing with a rebellion here, Song. And judging by the smell, there’s a lot of gunpowder around. This has been a long time in the making.”\r\n\r\n“So this started before Celestia even became the Queen Tyrant?”\r\n\r\n“My sister has many enemies,” Luna said. “I have told you so.”\r\n\r\n“And they’ve grown more confident, because I don’t remember ponies throwing daggers at your neck before you turned evil, Princess,” Daring said. “I don’t like this.”\r\n\r\n“So what are we going to do, Yearling?” Song poked her on the side. “Help the rebels or…? I mean, we are supposedly fighting Queen Tyrant Celestia.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know yet. I don’t like gunpowder.” Daring squinted. “I guess we’ll see when we get there.”\r\n\r\nAnd they got there.\r\n\r\nThe sewers grew more spacious, all of a sudden—and in the perfectly carved wall there was a huge metal door, the first one they’d seen since they came down there. Faint sounds could be heard from the other side, and the smell of powder was almost unbearable, rotten eggs and stale sulfur.\r\n\r\nSong and Daring Do looked at each other, and nodded.\r\n\r\nThey kicked the door down.\r\n\r\nNow—rebellions are hardly a new concept. For as long as civilization has existed, there have been ponies who thought they could improve it; and usually, it’s the kind of improvement that involves beheading someone else. Every individual in this world is unique, but crowds think exactly the same, no matter the place, time, or culture.\r\n\r\nDaring Do and Sugar Song had been there for most of them. They’d orchestrated the fall of Sleipnir the Eight-Legged, they’d prevented the Rise of the Colt Pixies, they had witnessed the death of the Thestral King.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, of all the marvelous, horrifying rebellions they’d ever known, this one, this little gunpowder plot? This is the one that surprised them the most.\r\n\r\nBecause when they kicked the door open, what they saw inside that room weren’t ponies. What awaited them were… \r\n\r\n“…Cows?” Daring asked, completely dumbfounded. “What?”\r\n\r\nAnd behind her, Luna’s eyes widened. “Oooooh. [i]Ooooooooooh![/i]” And her mouth widened in a grin. “I knew it! I knew something like this would happen! Oh, I cannot wait to rub this in my sister’s face. This is what happens when you do [i]politics[/i].”\r\n\r\nCows, indeed. Almost thirty of them, brown, black, and white. Most were drinking from huge mugs of—gosh, Song hoped that wasn’t milk, because that would be weird. Every cow had a green bandanna wrapped around their forehead.\r\n\r\nSugar Song and Daring Do looked at the cows.\r\n\r\nThe cows looked at Daring Do and Sugar Song.\r\n\r\nThe room, cows aside, was full of rebellious paraphernalia. Defaced pictures of Princess Celestia, of the Tyrant Queen, of both Princesses Luna. A pirate flag. Maps of Canterlot full of red marks and crosses. A million of barrels that stank of gunpowder. \r\n\r\nThen Daring’s ears perked up. “Oh, hey. So [i]that’s[/i] why the dagger reminded me of the Minotaur Queen's minitiara!”\r\n\r\nSong looked at her. “Yeah?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Their cultures are really similar.” Daring made a broad gesture with her hoof. “So, same blacksmithing techniques. I mean, they’re pretty much the same species anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Right.”\r\n\r\nThen one of the cows yelled with a high-pitched voice. “It’s the Princess!” she said. “We’ve been found!”\r\n\r\nAnd that’s when the stampede happened.\r\n\r\nForce equals mass times acceleration. This means that if many slightly unathletic cows charge at you at the same time, they will soon be unstop—\r\n\r\n“Nope,” Daring said.\r\n\r\n[i]PLAF![/i]\r\n\r\nAnd one uppercut later, the first cow of the bunch was sent flying, and that was pretty much it for the stampede. The rest of the cows took the much more sensible option of quietly shuffling backwards instead.\r\n\r\nLuna closed the door behind them and cast a spell on it. “There,” she said. “Now they cannot escape from us. We are free to do as we please.”\r\n\r\n“Kind of grim a thing to say, Your Highness.”\r\n\r\nDaring waved her hoof to cool it off, and then looked at Song. “This is a little underwhelming, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“After the minotaurs?” Song smiled. “A little, yeah. But still, Yearling… A cow rebellion? Never would’ve crossed my mind.”\r\n\r\n“You!” The leader of the cows—easy to identify: she was wearing an eyepatch—made her way out of the crowd and pointed an accusatory hoof at the heroes (and Luna). “I know who you are!”\r\n\r\nDaring arched an eyebrow. “Lost your chance to say ‘who you arrrrr’ there, buddy.”\r\n\r\n“I am not your buddy! You’re Daring Do!” the cow continued. “A friend of the Queen Tyrant! An ally of the tyrannical empire that’s enslaved our people for millennia!” Then she turned around, hoof in the air. “DEATH TO THE CROWN!”\r\n\r\n“[i]DEATH TO THE CROWN![/i]” the cows replied in one voice.\r\n\r\n“Wonderful,” Daring said. Then she raised her voice. “I’m not an ally of the crown anymore! I swore loyalty to Princess Celestia, not the Queen Tyrant. What is this?”\r\n\r\n“This!” the cow yelled, horrible smile on her face, “is our fight for freedom! This is the cows finally getting back what belongs to us! This is us breaking free of our shackles, defeating our oppressors! No longer will we be seen as second-class citizens!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose I can get behind that,” Daring Do said, frowning. “I don’t dig the pirate flag, but if this is about fighting the Queen Tyrant, we can maybe work togeth—”\r\n\r\n“Our [i]pony[/i] oppressors!” the cow continued. “Just like you! Just like everypony else!”\r\n\r\nThere is one rule in any fight. One rule that, no matter what, you must never break: do not underestimate your enemy. Even if they’re a bunch of obviously unprofessional cows, even if you can beat them up with three hooves tied to your back, never think you’ve won until you’ve won.\r\n\r\nWhile the cow with the eyepatch was screaming, one of the cows in the background had emptied her mug of whatever, and filled it with powder from one of the barrels. She then raised it carefully, trying her best not to be noticed.\r\n\r\nLuna, Song, and Daring noticed. They silently watched her, waiting for her move. Anticipating it.\r\n\r\nNot like it ever mattered.\r\n\r\nBecause the Minotaur King chose that exact moment to break through the outer wall.\r\n\r\n[b]KRRRNCH![/b]\r\n\r\n“RRRAAAAAAAAARGH!” He pointed at Daring Do. “I’VE FOUND YOU!”\r\n\r\nDaring flinched. One cow screamed.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s when the stampede [i]actually happened.[/i]\r\n\r\nThere are probably worse things than being trapped in a room with thirty panicky cows and pure unadulterated minotaur rage. Daring Do had some interesting things about being set on fire, for example.\r\n\r\nBut still, at that moment? Daring Do BBQ didn’t sound that bad.\r\n\r\nThe entire situation went out of control almost immediately—when the cows started running, and this time they were running [i]for real[/i], Daring and Luna were forced to just fly above them to avoid being ran over.\r\n\r\nBut Sugar Song had no wings, and as good a swordfighter she was, there are things you simply cannot parry.\r\n\r\n“HEYYY-YAAAA—”\r\n\r\n[i]Clang.[/i]\r\n\r\n“—AAAAAAW SHOOT—[i]AAAAAAARGH![/i]\r\n\r\nNot for lack of trying, however.\r\n\r\n“Sugar Song!” Daring had to stop herself from flying to the rescue—uncomfortable as it was, a stampede of cows wasn’t lethal, and there were bigger fishes to catch. “Dang it—Princess, can you get to Song and…?”\r\n\r\n“DARING DO!” the Minotaur King roared. “I WILL KILL YOU!”\r\n\r\n“…On second thought, Princess, how ‘bout you stay here and help me instead.”\r\n\r\n“[i]IIIII HEEEEAAAARD THAAAAAAT![/i]”\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King didn’t wait for Daring Do’s witty reply—instead he just charged, as minotaurs often do, waking clouds of gunpowder with his furious stomping. “RRARGH!” He swatted at Daring Do. “RRRARGH!” Twice.\r\n\r\nDaring Do dodged without issue, although the wind caused by the Minotaur King’s movements was enough to ruffle her feathers. “Hah!” she said. “Too slow!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed.” Luna had dodged, too, and now her eyes shone white. Her horn started to glow. “Do not worry, Daring Do. Now that I have my magic…” sparks started to come off the tip “…[i]this will be eas—[/i]”\r\n\r\n[i]BANG![/i]\r\n\r\nThe cloud of gunpowder exploded. \r\n\r\nLuna went out flying and hit a wall with a [i]plaf![/i] smoking slightly.  \r\n\r\nAt least, the Minotaur King also wobbled—but the explosion hadn’t grazed him as much as Luna, so he didn’t fall. He merely opened his arms wide, as if preparing for a hug, and then brought both palms together in a deadly clasp, crushing Daring between his palms.\r\n\r\nOr trying. “Olé!” Daring dodged by moving forward, flew right in front of the King’s dumb angry face, and gave him a cocky grin. “Now, now, Minotaur King. I know I’m great, but don’t you think an applause so soon is overdoing it a little?”\r\n\r\nHe headbutted her.\r\n\r\n[i]CRONCH![/i]\r\n\r\n“BWARGH!”\r\n\r\nAt least he hit her with his forehead, and not with his horns. Daring Do was sent flying, too—but unlike Luna, she didn’t hit a wall. She hit the ground.\r\n\r\nThe ground thirty cows were currently stampeding.\r\n\r\nEverything became too much of a mess to see where she was going. Nothing but an endless sea of hooves hitting her, screams in her ears, and red in her eyes. She could feel bruises forming already, and soon enough, she would feel her bones breaking under the pressure.\r\n\r\nShe tried to scream.\r\n\r\nThe sound was drowned by the stampede.\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King kept rampaging around the room, to no avail. With the door locked, the cows were trying their hardest to run away from him, and that meant running in circles. Daring Do was soon dragged by the current, and the Minotaur King lost sight of her.\r\n\r\nSo he just started grabbing cows and throwing them aside. “DARING DO!” he yelled. “THIS IS NOT ENOUGH! I WILL GET YOU WITH MY OWN HANDS!”\r\n\r\nAnd then, loud like the cock of a gun pressed against your forehead:\r\n\r\n[i]WH-TCHK![/i]\r\n\r\nThe crack of a whip.\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King heard it, and turned around, looking for the source—only to find that he couldn’t; the whip was rolled around his right horn, tugging, keeping him in place. \r\n\r\nBut the Minotaur King could not be tamed. He snarled, clenched his fists and he pulled with a strength out of this world…\r\n\r\n…and dragged Daring Do out of the avalanche with a [i]pop![/i] that sent some more cows flying. She had the whip between her teeth, and Sugar Song between her hooves.\r\n\r\nThe whiplash almost propelled them to the other side of the room—but Daring Do managed to stop in time, and then she just stood there, hovering, Sugar Song hugging her tightly, forelegs around her neck.\r\n\r\n“See?” Daring whispered, eyes never leaving the Minotaur King. “Just as planned. You okay?”\r\n\r\nSong’s eyes were wide. She was panting. “Y-yes. Yes, I, I’m—”\r\n\r\nDaring nodded. “Good. I’m really, [i]really[/i] sorry for this.”\r\n\r\n“What are you talking abooooOOOOAAAAAA—?”\r\n\r\nDaring Do grabbed Sugar Song with both hooves, circled around to gain momentum… \r\n\r\n“—AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA—”\r\n\r\nAnd threw Sugar Song as hard as she possibly could, and then darted right after her.\r\n\r\nBack by the door, the Minotaur King finally finished unwrapping his horn, and he threw the whip aside. He turned to Daring Do. “I AM GOING TO—”\r\n\r\n“—AAAAAAAAARGH!” \r\n\r\n[i]PLOMF![/i]\r\n\r\nHe got hit right in the face by a screaming Sugar Song travelling at terminal velocity, and then Daring Do came right after, and punched him in the stomach with the momentum of a particularly angry bullet.\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King felt the air leave his lungs.\r\n\r\nHe fell.\r\n\r\nSugar Song rolled away from his face, too dizzy to even talk, and promptly fell to the ground, limbs sprawled in all directions. Daring Do managed to land much more gracefully, and she stepped on the Minotaur King’s chest, slightly harder than necessary.\r\n\r\n“We can dance to this tune all day, King,” she said. “But I capoeira and you barely manage the Pony Pokey. So how about we [i]talk.[/i]”\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King glared at her. He looked like at any moment steam would come out of his nostrils. But he did not say a word, and he didn’t slap Daring Do aside.\r\n\r\n“That’s more like it,” Daring said. “You and I have the same goal in mind, Minotaur King. You might not like heroes—but you consider the Queen Tyrant your enemy. We can work together. Even this rebellion, stupid as it is, can be useful. If we get rid of the gunpowder, if we make sure no innocents are harmed, I’m sure that…”\r\n\r\nDaring Do’s words died in her mouth.\r\n\r\nShe hadn’t noticed with the thrill of the fight, but the room had gone completely silent. The cows weren’t screaming anymore—and they weren’t stampeding, either. They were merely standing with their backs against the furthest wall, looking at something behind them. \r\n\r\nHeck, even the Minotaur King wasn’t looking at Daring Do. She was going to say something about this but then the voice came.\r\n\r\n“Please, do not stop talking now, my dear Daring Do,” it said, and Daring’s pupils shrunk until they became two dots. “I believe I found your speech really interesting.”\r\n\r\nThe door had been opened. \r\n\r\nThe Queen Tyrant was there.\r\n\r\nSlowly, Daring Do turned. She faced Celestia, and now that Daring was standing on top of the Minotaur King’s chest, she was as tall as her. “Queen Tyrant,” she said. “We finally—”\r\n\r\n[i]PLAF![/i]\r\n\r\n“ARGH!”\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King slapped her away, and got up with surprising speed for someone this big. “Queen Tyrant,” he growled.\r\n\r\nThe Queen Tyrant shot him a lazy smile. “Minotaur King,” she said. “May I ask why your escort is trying their hardest to destroy my sewers?”\r\n\r\nFor somepony surrounded by people who wanted to kill her, Celestia certainly wasn’t stiff. Her shoulders and ears were perfectly relaxed, and she moved like she’d just spent an hour at the spa. In front of her, floating with yellow light, was a small cup of tea.\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King squinted, in that way dumb people do. “Bah!” he said. “Bah! Because you’re weak! You call yourself a tyrant, but you do not oppress! Heroes roam your Castle, and you do nothing! You failed to impress me!”\r\n\r\nCelestia nodded absent-mindedly, as she took a long sip from her cup and walked into the room. She meandered to one of her defaced pictures on the walls, and gave them an appreciative look. “I see,” she said. “A shame to hear that, Minotaur King. The Cowliphat and Equestria have never had friendly relations, but I hoped you and I would solve that.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” The Minotaur King punched his own chest. “Bah! We do not befriend the weak! We [i]crush[/i] them!”\r\n\r\n“I see.” She kept moving through the room, and whenever she got close to one of the cows, they would let out a yelp and move out of the way. Celestia paid them no mind. “I do not think of myself as a weak monarch, Minotaur King, but I must admit that I do not do shows of strength.” \r\n\r\nPause. A sly grin made its way to her face, and everybody saw it, even though she was facing a wall.\r\n\r\n“One could say,” Celestia continued, “they are [i]not my cup of tea.[/i]”\r\n\r\nAnd she threw the teacup to the ground between her and the Minotaur King.\r\n\r\nThe effect was immediate—the teacup, made of the finest porcelain, exploded into a million pieces. It made most of the cows flinch, although neither the Minotaur King, Daring, or Sugar Song batted an eye. And then…\r\n\r\n[i]Ffsssshhhhhhhh—[/i]\r\n\r\nThen they noticed that whatever had been inside that teacup was dissolving the floor wherever it touched it. Dissolving it faster than any acid Daring Do had ever seen.\r\n\r\nAnd Celestia had been [i]drinking[/i] that.\r\n\r\n“Oh, please, do excuse me,” Celestia said, and everybody turned to her once more. She was looking at the hole in the ground with a neutral expression. “I did not know it would do that. I guess the poison in my tea was a little stronger than expected.” And she turned to the cow with an eyepatch, and smiled. “Yet not strong enough, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\nThe cow’s eye went wide. “You… You knew?” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“Of the conspiracy?” Celestia asked, cocking her head slightly to the side. “Of course. I have been acquainted with poison for many centuries, my dear cow. That was not the first attempt against my life. I am sure it will not be the last.” Then she turned. “Minotaur King, I must ask you for forgiveness once more. I have some business to attend—my people are, ah, trying to take me down, it seems.”\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King blinked. “Uh.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, I am sure you’ll understand,” Celestia kept saying. “After all, you are a tyrant yourself. You know how revolutions start.” She looked at the cow. “They are merely, I assume, tired of being second-class citizens?”\r\n\r\nThe cow looked at Celestia. Then, at the Minotaur King. Then, at the rest of the cows.\r\n\r\nThen she gulped. “Y-yes.”\r\n\r\nCelestia nodded. “And you were expecting to blow up my castle, I assume. “\r\n\r\n“Um.”\r\n\r\n“A shame, then, that I found you. This is an impressive amount of powder. Perhaps now that your rebellion has been thwarted, the sewers will be safe to roam once more.”\r\n\r\nThe cow said nothing. The other cows also said nothing, but it was clear they were merely following their leader’s example.\r\n\r\nSo Celestia smiled. And, with an almost maternal air, she lowered her head to the eyepatched cow’s ear, and said, “This is the part when you run.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was pretty much it for the cows, really.\r\n\r\nThere’s something inherently comical in seeing thirty terrorized cows all trying to squeeze through the same tiny doorway at the same time, but somehow, Daring couldn’t even manage a chuckle. She just laid there, watching, and she kept watching until the last screaming bovine was out of the room, the sound of her hoofsteps fading away through the sewers.\r\n\r\nSomething pressed against her side, then—Sugar Song, frowning slightly. “We let them run?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“The sewers are a labyrinth,” Daring muttered back. “We’ll get them later.”\r\n\r\n“I hope. They stepped on me a lot. It hurts.”\r\n\r\n“Are you okay?”\r\n\r\n“Also, you threw me to the Minotaur King like I were a brick.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, but are you okay?”\r\n\r\n“With that said and done, Minotaur King,” Celestia said, and immediately everybody snapped back to attention. The room felt gigantic, now that it wasn’t crowded. “I suppose I still must address your last point. There are heroes in my castle.”\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur King looked at Daring Do. Daring Do squinted back at him, and mouthed the words “anytime you want, buddy.”\r\n\r\n“However,” the Queen Tyrant went on, “you’ll notice that my sister betrayed me and joined them, and she is currently blown up in that corner.” She nodded towards the still-smoking Luna. “As per Daring Do and Sugar Song—I will admit, I did not think they were worth my time.”\r\n\r\nSugar Song tensed. Daring and Celestia locked eyes.\r\n\r\n“But if you believe you can do anything to oppose me, Daring Do,” Celestia said, and she made a beckoning gesture and offered the sweetest of smiles, “you are more than welcome to try.”\r\n\r\nDramatic pause.\r\n\r\nDaring Do had gone to Tartarus and back, just to rescue Sugar Song. She’d trekked the twisted version of Canterlot Castle, she’d faced alicorns and minotaurs alike. She’d been trampled by a stampede, used a baby as a javelin, used [i]her best friend[/i] as a javelin. \r\n\r\nShe had done all those things, and more, for the sake of revenge. For the sake of taking down Queen Tyrant Celestia, who had betrayed her, who had hurt her so badly. She had done this for the sake of Equestria, but mostly, she had done it for herself.\r\n\r\nNothing, absolutely nothing, would stop her from standing to the Queen Tyrant, and taking her down.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the Queen Tyrant she was seeing.\r\n\r\nDark jewels or not, blood-red crown or not—she had seen that smile before.\r\n\r\nThis was Princess Celestia.\r\n\r\nSo Daring Do hung her head down, and spoke with defeat, because she [i]felt[/i] defeated. “No,” she said. Sugar Song looked at her with surprise, but she went on. “I can’t do anything. I surrender. You win.”\r\n\r\nCelestia nodded.\r\n\r\nAnd the Minotaur King started to laugh.\r\n\r\n“Hah!” he said, slapping his knee. “Hah! Hah-hah! Hah!” \r\n\r\n“Ugh.” From the corner, the smoky figure of Princess Luna arose. Her fur was darkened with ashes, but she looked mostly okay. “My head. What is happening?” she looked at the Minotaur King. “Are we laughing? I can laugh. Hah!”\r\n\r\n“Hah-hah!” The Minotaur King slapped his knee once more.\r\n\r\n“Wah, hah, hah!” Luna replied. “What is happening? Did I explode?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Princess,” Song said, still looking at Daring. “You—you can’t use magic when surrounded by gunpowder. It explodes.”\r\n\r\n“I see. I did not know that. I am afraid gunpowder is a recent invention,” Luna said. “Hah!”\r\n\r\n“Hah! Hah!” said the Minotaur King.\r\n\r\n“Wah, hah, hah! I am in agony. I am in dire need of medical attention.”\r\n\r\n“Song,” Daring said, elbowing her friend and nodding towards Luna, “go with her.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“To the hospital, or something. There are doctors in Canterlot, she’ll probably know where to look.” Daring shrugged. “She can probably blow a hole in the ceiling and fly you away.”\r\n\r\n“But Daring, the Queen Tyrant—”\r\n\r\n“I’ll explain later. Don’t worry, we’re safe.” She looked at Song in the eyes, and repeated: “we’re safe. Princess Luna is not a villain anyway, and she’s hurt.”\r\n\r\nSugar Song frowned, but she got up anyway. “Your Highness,” she said. “Let’s go. I’ll bring you to the hospital myself. I’m sure they give wonderful treatment to their oppressors.”\r\n\r\n“Wah, hah, hah!”\r\n\r\n“And you can stop laughing, now.”\r\n\r\n\"What happened, while I was unconscious?\"\r\n\r\n“I have no idea.” Song looked at the Minotaur King. “I think we… lost?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Sugar Song,” Celestia said. “You did. Thank you for your understanding.” And then her horn flashed. “Take this.” \r\n\r\nSong flinched, but grabbed the document Celestia had appeared anyway. She took a mere glance at it, and then her ears perked up. “Is this a map? Of the sewers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought they were too old? That all the maps had been lost?”\r\n\r\nCelestia smiled again. “They are,” she said. “And they were. But I am older. As you can see, there’s only one exit, which goes through the other side of the mountain. If Luna is not too badly hurt, perhaps you could…?”\r\n\r\nSong blinked in understanding, but sudden doubt swept over her face. She looked at Daring Do… and Daring Do nodded. So Song rolled up the map and kept it. “Will do, Your Majesty. See you later, Yearling. You’ll have some explaining to do.”\r\n\r\n“Sure.”\r\n\r\nSong nodded. “Come on, Your Highness. We’ve got stuff to do.”\r\n\r\n“Wah, hah, hah!”\r\n\r\n“I said you can stop laughing now.”\r\n\r\nDaring Do, Celestia, and the Minotaur King were left alone in that big sewer room full of gunpowder and rebellious items, and the King was still laughing. Eventually, however, he managed to catch his breath—and he immediately passed an arm around Celestia’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n“You are not weak!” he said, goofy stupid grin in his face. He somehow managed to make it look menacing anyway. “You are a true tyrant! You even defeated Daring Do!”\r\n\r\nCelestia smiled at him. “So it seems, my dear Minotaur King.”\r\n\r\n“We can be friends now, yes! Yes!” He laughed again. “I was wrong! You are not weak!”\r\n\r\n“You should probably go fetch your escort, King,” Celestia said, subtly pushing him towards the door. “They don’t know of your change of heart yet, and I’m afraid they are destroying my sewers still. I would love it if they stopped before hurting some of my subjects.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! Yes!” the Minotaur King couldn’t squeeze through the tiny doorway, so he just blasted through the wall with minimum effort. “I believe you and I can be friends, now! Two tyrants, yes! Yes! Hah-hah-hah!”\r\n\r\nHe left.\r\n\r\nDaring and Celestia, now, completely alone. None said a word for what felt like hours.\r\n\r\nAnd then Daring sighed, and got up. “Let me guess,” she said. “The minotaurs just [i]happened[/i] to destroy the sewers in a way that fixes them completely.”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” Princess Celestia said, “that minotaurs are smarter than they look. They must have not destroyed any critical part of the cave system, or else everything would have crumbled down by now. They probably kept themselves to destroying anything that blocked the main path.”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful.”\r\n\r\nCelestia chuckled. “I assume, then, that you have seen through my schemes? What gave it away?”\r\n\r\nDaring rolled her eyes, and walked out of the room. Celestia followed. “The teacup, I suppose,” Daring said after a while. “Or the entire speech, rather. Too perfect. Too planned. You’re not a dramatic pony—this was rehearsed.”\r\n\r\nCelestia nodded. “Guilty as charged.”\r\n\r\n“Also, you kept messing up your lines. Talking about teacups, and whatnot.”\r\n\r\n“I like that line.”\r\n\r\n“It shows.” Daring Do sighed. “Why?”\r\n\r\nCelestia said nothing, for a moment or two. She just looked at the ceiling, seemingly lost in thought. \r\n\r\nThen she talked. “I like chamomile tea,” she said.\r\n\r\nDaring arched an eyebrow. \r\n\r\n“I have been poisoned many times, Daring Do. I know a fair bit about poison. I also know how chamomile tea tastes—and lately, I found out that my personal selection tasted wrong.” She shrugged. “Not too much; just a little. They overdid the dose, they grew impatient. Luna pointed out the flavor, and I merely put two and two together. Somepony was trying to kill me. Again.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm.”\r\n\r\n“The minotaurs were growing belligerent, too,” Celestia continued. “We’ve never gotten along, Equestria and the Cowliphate, and I was afraid war was imminent. Minotaurs are interesting beasts. They only respect one thing, and that is individual strength. A strong leader does not listen to her people. Strong leaders kill heroes and create empires.” Celestia shook her head. “As a Princess, I could do nothing. As a Queen Tyrant? Perhaps I could stop a war.”\r\n\r\nDaring Do said nothing. She kept walking.\r\n\r\nCelestia looked at her, and then looked around. They were getting close to the hole Luna had created, not so long ago. Close to the exit.\r\n\r\n“…And of course, the sewers were a mess,” she added.\r\n\r\n“So you become a bad guy all of a sudden,” Daring Do said, “and the Minotaur King accepts to come to Equestria and maybe palaver with you for once. You kidnap Sugar Song, and in so make sure that I am here, and that I’m [i]angry.[/i] The Minotaur King sees this, approves of it, and then chases me to the sewers. And in the meantime, he cleans them.”\r\n\r\n“Being named the Queen Tyrant also made the assassins feel validated,” Celestia said. “I’ve seen many conspiracies in my lifetime, Daring Do. They all think they’re doing it for the greater good. If you show them they’re on the right path, they grow confident. They grow impatient.” A smile. “They move from poison to gunpowder… and they make themselves easier to find.”\r\n\r\n“And I take care of that too, of course.”\r\n\r\n“You are a brilliant pony, Daring Do. With the rebels being this active, I knew you would notice them. And locate them.”\r\n\r\nDaring frowned. “And you let them go?”\r\n\r\n“Did I?” Celestia asked, arching an eyebrow. “I think they’re being taken care of, my dear Daring Do.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\nSong and Luna stood right next to the sewers’ exit, listening to the sound of thirty cows getting closer by the second. Song had her rapier again. “So your head still hurts, Your Highness?” she was asking.\r\n\r\n“Indeed. I do not think I can use magic, Sugar Song. Wah-hah—”\r\n\r\n “Please, don’t.” The sound of the thirty cows got even louder. Song brandished her rapier, and tensed. “So, do you want to sit this one out, Your Highness?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, of course not.” Luna smiled. She was still perfectly relaxed. “I do not need to.”\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“No. I admit there is thirty of them, and I [i]am[/i] weakened, however. So this will take me around, say, five seconds.”\r\n\r\n“Huh.” Song shrugged. “Well, if you say so.”\r\n\r\nThirty seconds later, the cows arrived.\r\n\r\nLuna was proven right.\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n\r\n“An elegant solution,” Celestia was saying. They’d arrived at the hole, and they flew up—soon enough, they were back at the Castle. With the Princess leading, however, they were not going to get lost. “That I couldn’t hope to solve nearly half as quickly without resorting to drastic measures. I’m sorry, Daring Do. I did what I had to.”\r\n\r\n“You went mad with power.”\r\n\r\nCelestia smiled. “I apologize again. I needed you here, I needed you to fight against me. That’s why I kidnapped Sugar Song.” She shook her head. The corridor turned left. “We never hurt her—we kept her in magical stasis. Fed her twice a week. The strain on her body is much lesser than she thought.”\r\n\r\nDaring nodded. “And your ruling as Queen Tyrant?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the Minotaur King was right about that. I barely did anything.” A chuckle. “I have a very special student, Daring Do, and I think she would have never let me do this if I had truly oppressed my subjects.”\r\n\r\n“What about the cows?”\r\n\r\n“Let’s call that a lucky coincidence.”\r\n\r\n“Hm.” \r\n\r\nRiddles are hard, up till you know the answer. Canterlot Castle was not a riddle, but Celestia still knew the way—and soon enough, they arrived at the Throne Room. It was still dark and broody, but Celestia wasted no time opening the curtains, getting some light in there.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly it felt much more like home, Daring mused.\r\n\r\nWhen she talked, however, there was no whim in her voice. “You didn’t tell me.”\r\n\r\nCelestia was busy with the throne at the moment—trying to decide if she was going to keep the obsidian, probably—but she turned around almost instantly. “Beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“Your scheme. You wanted me to come here and impress the Minotaur King, and find out about the rebellion, and all that.” She squinted. “But I could have done that easily without thinking that you had betrayed me. You [i]hurt me[/i], Celestia.”\r\n\r\nCelestia’s expression was grave. “I’m sorry.” And she sat on her obsidian throne. “But I had to.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because I handpick my own tea, Daring Do,” Celestia explained, and her voice was soft. “I have done so for centuries—but suddenly, there was poison in it. To be able to sneak past my security measures, they… They had to be close, whoever they were.”\r\n\r\n“So you didn’t tell me.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t tell anypony,” Celestia said. “I became the Tyrant Queen. Because, to be able to poison my tea, they needed eyes and ears everywhere. I needed them to grow impatient, bold—and I couldn’t risk them knowing I was not a real tyrant… But then, it turned out, it was the milk that held the poison. I shouldn’t have worried, and the conspiracy was much smaller than I thought.” She smiled. “Let’s call this a little lesson of humility. I shouldn’t have done this. I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\nDaring Do sighed. “Princess, I—” and then she stopped. A blink. “Wait a moment,” she said. “You didn’t tell anypony?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Not even Princess Luna?”\r\n\r\n“No.” Celestia cocked her head to the side. “Why?”\r\n\r\n“Uh. I just.” Daring Do sat down on the floor, and rubbed the back of her neck. “…Huh. You know, maybe you should keep an eye on her, just in case.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t need to. I know she would never betray me.”\r\n\r\n“No, yeah, that’s true—but she has some really interesting ideas about children, you see.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure I needn’t worry, my dear Daring Do.” And then Celestia’s horn flashed, and she went back to normal. Her crown turned golden once again. The black jewels disappeared. Her eyes became gentler.\r\n\r\nAnd Daring Do grunted. “So that’s it?”\r\n\r\nCelestia nodded. “That’s it. I’ll hold palaver with the Minotaur King. The rebel cows will be prosecuted in due time. The sewers are halfway fixed already, and it will be easy to finish them. I will continue to rule as a Queen Tyrant for a month, and then I will go back.” Her eyes sparkled. “And I hope that my little ponies will forgive this little scheme of mine.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was it, really. That was the end of the adventure. Daring felt it—call it a gut feeling—and she relaxed, though she couldn’t help feeling a little bit bugged. It was like cheating. There had been no final battle, no great evil to take down.\r\n\r\nBut at least Celestia was still her friend. And, she noticed, she really liked that. \r\n\r\nSo perhaps it wasn’t all that bad. Just a bit annoying.\r\n\r\n“Princess,” Daring Do said, taking off her hat and stretching her wings, already thinking on how she would explain this to Song. Should she mention Luna hadn’t been faking? Probably not. Those two liked each other a lot; better not to risk ruining their friendship. “This was needlessly complicated. Sometimes I cannot tell if you are an absolute genius, or an absolute idiot, and I say that from the bottom of my heart.”\r\n\r\nAnd Celestia replied to this with a grin. “Oh, my dear Daring Do. I must say, there is really not that much of a difference between the two.” And there was a twinkle in her eye as she spoke. “Reality is shaped like a horseshoe, that way.”

Monday. I didn't hate Mondays, but only because it meant I got to go to work again. Work was [I]the[/i] high point of my week, but the drain on my creativity always left me feeling worn out. But work was not exactly what I had always dreamed it would be. I work in fashion, of course, but entry-level jobs in the industry were not quite the extent of my ambition.\r\n\r\nI unlocked my front door and pushed it open. Mom and Dad had given me a house in the city, which was all kinds of amazing, particularly when it came to giving me some peace and quiet after a long day. I dropped my portfolio case off beside the couch in the living room, kicked off my pumps, and headed into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"Home, sweet home, Rarity, and what are you going to do?\" I asked myself.\r\n\r\nA drink was my first order of business. Something cool and long, after all, I had more work to get through. College should have been the end of homework, but I almost longed for the \"relaxing\" days spent sketching designs and chatting with friends.\r\n\r\nJust thinking of my (high-school and eventually college) friends infused me with energy, magic. Weekends were when we got together, played some music, went out to a club, or just chilled as a group.\r\n\r\nI poured myself a glass of orange juice, and retired to the living room. The moment I sat down on my couch a familiar bleep came from my bag. Never underestimate the speed with which a young woman can produce their mobile devices from [I]any[/i] location, locked or open. I had that phone in my hand so quickly Wyatt Earp would have whistled in appreciation.\r\n\r\nRainbow Dash was the first to message me, as always. We had spoken just the previous day, so while it was good to chat, we lacked much to talk about. The topic of guys came up—as it always did when talking with Rainbow Dash—and I had to dutifully report that I had indeed spent a few moments watching the office supplies guy bending down to pick something up.\r\n\r\nMy phone beeped again and of a tone that implied a conversation with someone else.\r\n\r\nSwapping conversations, I found the new contact easily enough. Instead of a number, a name appeared—a fake name.\r\n\r\n\"Who would NotABug be?\" I asked out loud.\r\n\r\nThen it hit me. The only reason a new contact would have a name instead of a number would be if something on my phone assigned one, and there was something that did just that.\r\n\r\nI flicked to Rainbow Dash's conversation, and informed her the stupid \"Date Night\" app she had made me install might have gotten me something. Despite the sudden flood of requests from Rainbow Dash, asking me for details, I flicked back to NotABug.\r\n\r\n[code]—Hi!—[/code] the message read.\r\n\r\nIt was as simple as a first message could be; at least he didn't use emoji. My thumbs flicked across the virtual keyboard.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Hi back. Is that your real name?—[/code] I asked.[/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Might as well be. You're Rarity?—[/code]\r\n\r\nI smiled at the thought he had read the profile I had posted. When I first installed the thing, most of the messages I got from the app's users implied they had stopped their perusing at my chest.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Sure am. So, tell me about yourself?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—You've probably heard this a million times. I'm a digital entity with no bounds or limitation.—[/code]\r\n\r\nSnorting a laugh, I replied to his message with exactly that.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—LOL No, really.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Really. I was floating through the sea of infinite cat pictures, and saw an angel.—[/code]\r\n\r\nIt was such a corny and well-used pickup line—and used in a twisted a humorous way—that I laughed again. Much as I could handle Rainbow Dash's terrible spelling and grammar, I quite enjoyed NotABug's diction.\r\n\r\nThat he didn't follow up immediately with another message was also a point in his favor. I reached for my glass of juice and, taking my time, lifted it to my mouth and took a sip.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—You smooth talker. I bet you say that to all the girls.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nHis replies, after I had messaged, were always prompt. My heart beat a little quicker, wondering if this internet Casanova might be local. It was nice knowing I had his attention, too. There was an obvious reply I was expecting, that I knew for sure he would use.\r\n\r\n[code]—All of them so far. You're the first, by the way.—[/code]\r\n\r\nI almost coughed. The usual reply of \"Only the pretty ones\" had been not only avoided, but twisted. I reread what he had sent. NotABug was a conundrum and a curious courtier. For a moment I struggled to assemble more \"C\" words in my head for some alliteration, but they all fled from my grasp.\r\n\r\nReading his message for a third time, I pondered over his second sentence. If he was telling the truth, he might be yet-untouched by the slime of mobile dating apps. Or he's a player and uses the same corny lines on [I]all[/i] the girls he chats up.\r\n\r\nA sense of duty hit me, and my eyes slid across to my work folio. I let out a little groan of defeat: I had to get some designs finished for tomorrow.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Sorry, NotABug, but I have a pile of things to finish for work tomorrow. How about messaging me this time after work tomorrow, and we can chat more?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nThe time would be perfect. Not only could I get the designs finished, but I could also do some sleuthing. Twilight Sparkle—not the princess, the geeky one… the born-human-geeky-one—had taught me a little about poking around online.\r\n\r\n[code]—Only if you send me a kiss.—[/code]\r\n\r\nHis reply earned another laugh from me. I tapped the X key, and hit send; there was no further reply.\r\n\r\nFunny, not pushy, talks (or, at least, texts) nicely… My thoughts trailed off for a moment. I ignored the thirty-six messages from Rainbow Dash and activated the app she had forced upon me. Sure enough, a profile came up as matched, and typically it was a person in a dark room.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course! I put my picture out there for anybody at all to look at, but he keeps himself hidden.\"\r\n\r\nI stuck my tongue out at the dark, silhouetted character. He had a negative point against his name, now, which made me feel a lot better about NotABug. No one with all positives existed—[i]unicorns[/i] were in Equestria not Canterlot.\r\n\r\nReading his bio, it seemed to be the absolute minimum to fill in to make a profile for the site. Age was twenty-two (the same as mine), height was six feet, and sex was (of course) male.\r\n\r\nAll that was practically expected. No one was who they pretended to be online, but there were always traces. Not having anything but a single internet nickname wasn't a great issue, either: people always reused names.\r\n\r\nI watched the message counter on Rainbow Dash's name tick up by two more and swapped to a browser window. I simply typed his nickname into a search engine and tapped go.\r\n\r\n\"Well played, dear. Well played indeed,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThe first page was a wash. All the links were for programming sites, and one for an online game. I tapped the search field again, and added \"Date Night\" on the end. This brought me more meat. His name was right at the top, with his profile on Date Night.\r\n\r\nUnder that, where I expected to see more profiles on other app sites, there was nothing. Instead, I found another programming thing, but something was different about this one. It wasn't a \"bug report\" like the others, but instead it was the username.\r\n\r\n\"Casanova is a nerd? Oh my, and I will be his first?\"\r\n\r\nI sipped more of my juice and slid back on the couch. Further entries from the search revealed people talking about NotABug in an online forum, but I couldn't find any links to the real world.\r\n\r\n\"'Come, Watson. The game is afoot,'\" I quoted.\r\n\r\nFurther searches turned up nothing new. NotABug was as mysterious as he was well-spoken. After half an hour of prodding at the search engine to give me something useful, I gave up and got my work out. There was always more work to do, after all, and Casanova would be back tomorrow.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nMy morning was typical, leading up to an average day (made a little more sane because I had done the \"homework\" the previous night) that again left me rather drained. But, there was something different tonight. Something that wasn't the same heat-and-eat meal while working on fashion designs as every other day.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I signed off from work two hours after quitting time, grabbed up the work I still had to finish, and shoved it into my folio and made my way out to my car.\r\n\r\nRainbow Dash's car was an extension of her personality: fast, loud, uncaring of how it pollutes the world around it. My car was the exact opposite of everything hers was: compact, quiet, economical, cute. I loved my little car every bit as much as Rainbow Dash loved hers.\r\n\r\nI slumped down into my car, tossed my portfolio to the passenger seat, and contemplated my rising anticipation of NotABug's contact tonight. Fastening my seat-belt, I did a quick check of the car and everything around it in my mirrors, and pressed the starter.\r\n\r\nMy car was silent until it got moving. The little engine started after the electrics got me rolling, and I was away. Navigating the carpark of work was simple, repetitive. By the time I got to the exit of the parking garage I already had some music playing, and was comfortable in the simple role of driving again.\r\n\r\nPulling out into traffic, I was startled when the brakes locked up and stopped me just as a large pickup was swerving into the lane I almost entered. The dashboard had a flashing warning that could not be missed.\r\n\r\n\"Proximity warning?!\" I asked, quoting the words from the display.\r\n\r\nMy heart was racing a little as the realization set in: my cute little car, without all the stuff Rainbow Dash had told me were \"required\" for a car to have, had probably just saved my life.\r\n\r\nA horn sounded behind me, shocking me into action. I merged out into evening traffic, and drove all the way home with no further incident.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was my key in the front door lock and turning than my phone beeped. Excitement hit me like a wave. I swung my bag around, almost twirled my phone in my hand like a gunslinger, and activated the screen.\r\n\r\n[code]—Club 2nite?—[/code]\r\n\r\nA night at a club with Rainbow was tempting, but I had [i]plans[/i]. I kicked my shoes off and followed my normal routine. Juice, couch, relax, and then look back at my phone.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—If you must know, I am awaiting a reply from that guy I mentioned last night.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—What he look like? Hawt?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I haven't met him yet.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—I bet he fugly—[/code]\r\n\r\nEach time Rainbow Dash didn't use proper diction, it burned me a little. NotABug was delightful in that respect, and had spoiled me. I started typing a correction, even expanding out the portmanteau, then deleted the attempted intervention.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I'm waiting for his message now. He agreed to text me tonight.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—So club?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—No, Rainbow Dash, I have work tomorrow and I don't want to fall behind.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI also didn't want NotABug to contact me while I was out and couldn't enjoy his eloquence, but I wouldn't have said that to Rainbow Dash.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—So I'll be spending the night in.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—So no?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—No, darling. No clubbing tonight.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Send pics if he qt—[/code]\r\n\r\nDespite Rainbow Dash's crassness, and her horrible spelling, she was still one of the best friends I had ever had. It took just one look at the laughing, winged maniac in the profile picture to remind me of every moment we had been together at school.\r\n\r\nMy phone beeped again.\r\n\r\nI flicked to NotABug's conversation so quickly I barely even noticed it had a message notifier on it.\r\n\r\n[code]—Hi again.—[/code]\r\n\r\nAs far as greetings went, he was improving. I didn't want to appear [I]too[/i] impatient, so set my phone down, reached for my drink, and calmly took a slow sip. Telling myself that I wasn't being hasty, I grabbed my phone back up and started replying.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Hello. Prompt, I see.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nAs I checked, I realized that his first message tonight was at exactly the same minute past the hour as the previous night. I could appreciate that, but there were some things I wanted to get from him tonight.\r\n\r\n[code]—Is it a bad time?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Of course not. I did suggest you contact me now, after all. I find myself wondering a lot about my new admirer.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Like?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Well, your profile on Date Night™ said so little.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nThe moment after I hit send, I ground my teeth at the TM that had appeared. The app must have squeezed that into my phone's dictionary. Quickly, I typed out Date Night again, got the TM on the end, and marked it as a mistake.\r\n\r\n[code]—It does. Would you like to know something about me, then?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Of course, tease.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Well, we should play a game. I'll tell you something, and you tell me something. If either of us thinks the answers are too short, we get to ask a question.—[/code]\r\n\r\nTruth or dare without the dare. This could be a [I]very[/i] fun, and [I]very[/i] embarrassing game. Of course, I was all-in since he was a complete stranger. After waiting a moment, I realized he intended me to go first.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I just adore ice-cream.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—I will have to get you some, when I see you. When I see a pretty girl, I always try to picture what she is thinking, how she thinks, before noticing her beauty.—[/code]\r\n\r\nThis was less banal information and more a telling fact of his psyche. I read his message several times, and tried to make sense of what it meant in relation to him contacting me.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—So you read my bio before looking at my cleavage?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—You didn't give me a fact.—[/code]\r\n\r\nI seethed a little, but then broke into a giggle: he had me playing along quite well, and letting me pick my own answers to give made him ring a lot less of \"sleaze.\"\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I almost got into a car accident today. I was saved by my car.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Saved by your car? Not enough info there. How did it make you feel that this machinery, this program, saved your life?—[/code]\r\n\r\nExpecting him to ask a deeper question was one thing; having him spend such on something so strange made me remember he was a programmer, after all. I thought back to the moment, when my heart had raced.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I hugged the steering wheel. My car has never been much beyond a pretty little thing that got me from A to B, but right then… Right then, my car was my hero.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—I like playing with computers. They sing when I touch them.—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I already knew that. When you look at my picture, what do you see?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our conversations, there was a pause before his reply. I had surprised him, it seems.\r\n\r\n[code]—Your eyes. Azure, deep as the void, and brimming with intelligence. I see a young woman in them that has so much she wants to do that it is a struggle to fit it all in the hours of the day.—[/code]\r\n\r\nMy hand was fanning my face as I read, and my heart beat just as fast as when the car had saved my life. I breathed a deep, happy sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Rarity, don't you dare fall for him before you have even seen his picture,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course not. But, you know, it's [I]nice[/i] to be told you are beautiful,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"It is, yes.\"\r\n\r\nI know I shouldn't talk to myself like that, but I had to giggle at how well his flirt had hit home. I felt happy on a weeknight, and I owed it to NotABug.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—You make me laugh, in a good way. And don't you dare say that isn't enough. I'm opening my heart, here.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Now we know some more about each other.—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I went first, NotABug. It is your turn, and being as you didn't give a satisfactory answer, I get to ask a question. If a pretty woman (smart, too) walked up to you, put her arms around your shoulders and kissed you, would you gaze into her eyes or close yours?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nReaching for my glass of juice, I lifted it and took a slow, satisfying drink. I felt like the cat that had eaten the canary, the Cheshire Cat, or any one of a dozen other predators who had just brought a paw down on each side of their prey, and watched them squirm.\r\n\r\n[code]—I would look deeply into your eyes. I would keep looking until I could see us together within them.—[/code]\r\n\r\nI stared at his reply, stood up, and walked into the kitchen—still holding my phone. Using my magic, which Twilight said I shouldn't use except when necessary, I collected a tub of ice-cream from the freezer and a long-handled spoon. I returned to the living room with a relaxed smile on my face.\r\n\r\nMutely, I popped the top on the tub and scooped the first little lump of the nut-infused, cherry ice-cream into my mouth. The flavor exploded, but though I wanted to close my eyes and savor it, I looked back down at NotABug's replies.\r\n\r\nThe little girl that lived inside me let out a happy squeal, covered her mouth with her hands too late, and bounced up and down in excitement. Despite my conversation with her earlier, she still wanted to fall head over heels for this stranger. For just the evening, I supposed, I could let her have some fun.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—My friend had me install this app. I set up my account hoping to find someone I could at least talk to.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—You can talk to me.—[/code]\r\n\r\nThe reply seemed odd. One moment he was smooth as silk, the next he was awkward. I tried to put it down to inexperience, at least I hoped it was so.\r\n\r\nI selected his last comment, highlighted and copied the text, and then quickly flicked to my phone's browser. Twilight Sparkle's lessons on using the internet seemed to always drift back at the oddest times: I wrapped the search in quotes.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—www.pickuplines.com/toplist—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Alright, you caught me out. I haven't had much experience at this. Would you forgive me?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Answer my question properly, then. No searching. No websites.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—I would look into your eyes, but I would search them for you, for what makes you so clever, generous, and cute.—[/code]\r\n\r\nThere was the ring of truth this time, that the romantic girl inside me stuck her tongue out at. I didn't care what [I]she[/i] thought, though, I preferred the honest answer.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Much better. Maybe I should have asked for a no-cheating rule at the start?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—What would the penalty be?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—A kiss.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nThe little girl had gotten control of my thumbs.\r\n\r\n[code]—X—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Same time tomorrow?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Absolutely.—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—X—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for five minutes and getting no more replies, I turned my screen off and stretched out on the couch like a cat—a cat with a big tub of ice-cream. I squirmed, twisted, and laughed just for the sake of laughing.\r\n\r\nNotABug had not actually lied, he had just borrowed words; I considered that half a point off for him. But he had come back with something actually sweet, and more cute because I imagined the phantom \"him\" saying it.\r\n\r\nI reread the conversation while I ate more ice-cream, and contemplated my answer to his car-saving-me question. Sitting on the couch, I realized, wasn't going to let me explore that feeling.\r\n\r\nGrabbing my keys, phone, and the tub of ice-cream, I headed into the cool air of evening, and walked over to where my car was parked. Walking near the car with my keyfob caused it to unlock, so all I had to do was lift the handle and climb in.\r\n\r\nThe moment I was inside, with the door closed, a sense of safety flowed around me. I smiled and woke my phone back up with a touch.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—It's more than just being my hero. My car is a safe place, somewhere I could feel protected. I don't know if even my own home feels as safe as this little machine.—[/code] I sent[/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—You feel so much for something that isn't even alive?—[/code]\r\n\r\nHis reply was fast, lightning quick. He had to be holding his phone, and be an expert at thumb-typing. I scooped up some ice-cream and pondered this while experiencing frozen-dessert-bliss.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Yes. Of course. I didn't get into a collision, and it was the little ball of circuits in my car that stopped that. I can still be thankful to them. I love my sewing machine, and my overlocker too, and neither of those has saved my life.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI managed to eat two more spoonfuls without any reply from NotABug. As each morsel of delicious, hip-expanding ice-cream went down, I held my phone up and waited for a reply.\r\n\r\n\"This isn't like him. Or maybe the faster replies are less like him?\" I asked, of no one but myself.\r\n\r\n[code]—I think that's cute, and honest. I'm sorry about earlier, the thing with the pickup lines, but I really like talking with you.—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—You are forgiven.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nIn my safe place, my little car, I felt my heart quicken; did I dare hint at more? Of course I would—with the proper precautions.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Maybe we should meet up and have a drink somewhere?—[/code] I sent, jumping in before he could reply.[/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—You want to meet me? I will try to work out a way to do that.—[/code]\r\n\r\nHis reply was cryptic. Did he mean that he was working long hours? Was I trying to move too fast? The last thought was that it was some kind of psychology thing to encourage me to meet him in private; that was never going to happen.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—We'll talk again tomorrow.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—X—[/code]\r\n\r\nMy reply was almost automatic now.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—X—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI ended up finishing what was left in the bowl and retiring inside. My brave, clever little car gave a soft beep as I walked away—locking itself. All too soon I found myself with my designs out on the table, sketching additions and notes here and there. My work, although being the core of my life, seemed more draining than energizing.\r\n\r\n\"You're just pining because NotABug is being mysterious. Of course he's mysterious, he's a stranger.\"\r\n\r\nI let out a sigh, having had my tiny tantrum, and returned to my work.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nWork was consuming. My efforts the previous night meant I only had a normal workload today. I found myself sighing again and again as I sketched, measured, and designed my life away.\r\n\r\nI honestly spent most of the day trying not to fall asleep; I wasn't tired, I was weary.\r\n\r\nA blink. That was all. I was adjusting an existing pattern design to have minimal changes to make it usable as something completely new. I blinked, and woke up to the sound of my phone beeping.\r\n\r\nMy first instinct was to look around in case anyone saw me, but as I stood up, I saw that the room was empty. I pulled my phone out and looked at the source of the beep: I had five messages, all from NotABug. Further, it was almost an hour after our normal chat time, and the only reason my phone had made a noise was \"work mode\" had timed out.\r\n\r\nQuickly piling my work into my folio, I turned to leave my cubicle, and saw a letter taped to the wall behind me.\r\n\r\n\"A reprimand? I've been doing all the work, and overtime, and I get a reprimand for resting my eyes?!\" I said, shouting my dismay.\r\n\r\nI ripped the notice off the wall, stuffed it into my bag, and began stomping out. The time-clock was an obstacle, but I could deal with that by simply waving my employee card past. The moment I opened the door and slid into my car, I felt the hurricane inside me ease off.\r\n\r\nMy phone beeped again, and I realized I hadn't let NotABug know what was happening. I had to scroll back to start reading his messages.\r\n\r\n[code]—Hello.—[/code]\r\n\r\n[code]—Hi. Are you there?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[code]—Are you in trouble?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[code]—I hope you're not mad about those pickup lines.—[/code]\r\n\r\n[code]—I'm sorry if I've offended you.—[/code]\r\n\r\nI couldn't help but smile a little at how worried he had gotten, but then my eyes scanned to the last message.\r\n\r\n[code]—Is something wrong?—[/code]\r\n\r\nWith a deep sigh, I started typing a reply.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—You don't deserve to deal with my problems, but it's work. I don't know why, but it just seems to be draining, now.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Draining?—[/code]\r\n\r\nI found myself nodding to his message.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I need to drive home. I'll tell you more when I get there.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nReaching down, I pressed the starter of my car, and could swear I felt its excitement at being put to use—its purpose. The drive home was a joy, and I found myself sitting in my car, in my driveway, all too soon.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for looking after me,\" I said, patting the steering wheel.\r\n\r\nI climbed out of my car and walked inside. I collected a fresh tub of ice-cream, a spoon, and my usual juice, then settled down at the end of the couch. With a tug, I pulled out a comforter I kept folded under the coffee table for just such a situation\r\n\r\nA shimmy and a kick later and I was out of my chic suit pants and with a little more work my blouse joined them. Clad only in socks and my underwear, I curled up under the comforter and tapped my phone.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Okay. I'm snug and ready. Do you want to see?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI didn't wait for him to reply, I held my phone out, turned the front-facing camera on, and snapped a selfie. I looked at it a moment, and a devilish smirk pulled at one corner of my mouth. Easing the comforter down around my chest, I let a hint of cleavage show, and more importantly a little of my bra strap. I snapped a shot, then waited a moment and double-checked the picture before I sent it to NotABug.\r\n\r\n[code]—You look cute, Rarity,—[/code] he sent.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Not sexy? Not hot? Just cute?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Any man could tell you that. I said what I felt. You look cute.—[/code]\r\n\r\nHis clarification was oddly sweet, although I still wanted him to tell me how hot I looked. It had been too long since my last fling, that was for sure.\r\n\r\n[code]—What happened at work?—[/code]\r\n\r\nHis broken pattern caught me off-guard. But his question also made me think of work.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I love designing dresses, outfits, and entire ensembles. Work has me redesigning last year's outfit designs for the current season, using as much of the old designs as possible to avoid changing the manufacturing process too much. It is literally the exact thing I hate about the fashion industry.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nBy the time I was done typing, my thumbs were sore and there were tears in my eyes. I reached out for the juice first, drank half the glass, then popped the top of the ice-cream. Caramel-rocky-road, one of the best things that existed in the known universe. Two scoops of the stuff were in my mouth and melting, slowly, before I realized NotABug had replied.\r\n\r\n[code]—Have you thought about working elsewhere?—[/code]\r\n\r\nI laughed, but it was a sharp sound—sarcastic.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—If I quit at Polomare Fashion, I will just be stuck in a similar job at another fashion house. Or worse, I will be asking people if they, \"Want fries with that?\"—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Your profile said you like creating things.—[/code]\r\n\r\nBlinking at his reply, tried to comprehend what he meant. Was it simply a droll sense of humor, or was he being serious that working in a fast food diner would satisfy my creative urges?\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—It's not just creating. I am, technically, creating at my job, but it isn't the kind of thing I was born to do, darling. I want to make fashion; I want to be free with my muse, to run where I wish and not be under the yoke of another.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI got through three more scoops of ice-cream, and finished off my juice without a reply from NotABug. Lifting the spoon again, I was about to spear another morsel when my phone beeped. I was mildly surprised, and noticed it was a message from Sunset Shimmer.\r\n\r\nFlicking across to Sunset's name, I scanned down to see there was only one new entry.\r\n\r\n[code]—Rarity, we're organizing a party at Fluttershy and Maud's house on the weekend. You in?—[/code] it read.\r\n\r\nI was halfway through replying, when an idea came to me. Although it was mostly seeing NotABug's name flash with a message, and my phone beeping, that gave me the idea.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Sure. Their two-year anniversary, right? Mind if I bring a +1?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Can't see why not. This the guy Rainbows been telling everyone about?—[/code]\r\n\r\nI cursed Rainbow Dash and missing apostrophes.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Yes. I met him through a dating app, and wanted to meet him in person. Doing so with all my friends around seems like the prudent course of action.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Good idea. You can't be too careful. See you there, then?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—With or without him, darling.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nIn my moments with Sunset, I didn't even notice NotABug had replied. Flicking across to his conversation.\r\n\r\n[code]—You are beautiful, Rarity. Inside and out.—[/code]\r\n\r\nThe timestamp said it was two minutes old. He could wait a moment longer while I ate some more ice-cream. Only after the second spoonful did I start tapping a reply.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I would love to say the same, but I haven't seen you yet.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—What would be your ideal day at work?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—My ideal day would involve a place where I could work with the people who want me to design them things. I wouldn't make things to be mass-produced, I would make things to be worn.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nMy thumbs itched to write more. I wanted to cram all my hopes and dreams for the future into one text message. NotABug was apparently [I]very[/i] good at stirring my emotions up.\r\n\r\n[code]—You will be able to do that at Polomare Fashion?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—There? Of course not. They wouldn't dream of making less than ten thousand of any particular dress. They make things to put on shelves so that people think that is what they want.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI didn't need him to reply to see the problem I had just revealed: I was working at a job, at the lowest rung on the ladder, without wanting to reach the higher rungs.\r\n\r\n[code]—Then why are you there?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I should get my work done. Same time tomorrow?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Of course. XXX—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—XXX—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI hated myself for cutting things off, and using the work I actually had to do as an excuse just made it worse. I slumped into the couch, and had to fight to keep my tears back.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly half an hour—and half a tub of ice-cream—I finally collected myself enough to get my work out. Another design that needed a little something done at the shoulder to distinguish it from last year's fashion.\r\n\r\nI sighed.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nNo matter how much I stared at the patterns, my creativity seemed dead. The realization NotABug had led me to the previous night stung my very being: I had realized I was working at a job I hated that wouldn't lead me anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like fries with that?\" I asked, of no one in particular.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the day I lied. I modified dress designs using cuts that I had already used on others. I even managed to tell myself that this would work, that it would be enough. But, at least on some level, I didn't believe it.\r\n\r\nThe moment clock-out time came, I stood up and stuffed the patterns into my bag. I was three hours early compared to the normal time I left, and two earlier than everyone around me would dare leave at. I grabbed up my bag and turned around to leave.\r\n\r\n\"Finished your work already?\" my boss' boss, Coco Pommel, asked. Her tone implied more surprise than maliciousness.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed impeccably, something I had completely failed to notice all day. A beautiful, light yellow dress, a cute little scarf tied around her throat, and a neckline that gave nothing away.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Miss Pommel, but I'm feeling rather poorly. I'll get all this done at home, I promise,\" I said.\r\n\r\nShe eyed me for a moment before replying.\r\n\r\n\"Only because you have done some of your best work at home. Please, do feel better by tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation had the effect of drawing onlookers. Eyes poked up above cubicle walls, and I could see pure envy in each of them. I hadn't felt such malice directed my way since the three, huge specters of The Dazzlings had faced off against me and my friends.\r\n\r\nI wanted to be gone so badly I almost pulled my pumps off and ran.\r\n\r\nIt was a surprise when I reached my car. The moment the door was open, and the unique smell of the interior hit me (a mixture of my own perfume, a faded lemon air freshener, and \"car interior smell\"), I started to relax. I tossed my folio across to the passenger side, and headed in after it.\r\n\r\nAs I pulled the door closed, more tension eased. I was safe in my car—my clever little car. I reached to my bag and pulled out my phone. Another telemarketer had gotten my number, it seemed: there were five calls that my phone had blocked while I was at work. I brought up NotABug's conversation and sent him the first message for the day.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—🤗—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI hated emoji with a passion, but right then I needed to let him know what I needed.\r\n\r\n[code]—🤗 What's up?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—On my way home early. I'll chat when I get there.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nJust seeing that stupid, little pictogram from him made me feel better. I put my phone down and reached for the car's starter. As always, it lit up without a noise. My trip home was spent in an emotional numbness—if I dared to feel, I would start crying.\r\n\r\nThe moment I pulled into my driveway, my tears started to flow. I detested my work and what it now symbolized: it was a trap around my creativity, holding me in place, never letting go. I could climb the corporate ladder as high as it would go, become a supervisor, then a manager, and even into upper management; each step I climbed would mean even less design work.\r\n\r\nMy phone bleeped, pulling my attention away from self-pity for a moment. I reached out a hand and picked it up.\r\n\r\n[code]—Are you home? What's up?—[/code] NotABug sent.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—You were right. My job is a one-way trip to nowhere.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nWith my mood broken, I grabbed my phone and folio, and left the absolute safety of my car. The walk to my front door was practically a run, and no sooner was I inside than I threw my folio to the side, kicked off my shoes, and flopped on the couch.\r\n\r\nHolding out my phone, I woke it back up and brought NotABug's conversation up with a quick swipe. And at that exact moment, his reply came.\r\n\r\n[code]—Anything I can do to help?—[/code]\r\n\r\nIt was a bad idea—a terrible idea—but I needed someone to talk to who wouldn't just agree with everything I had to say. Last night had woken me up to something: I had no one in my life to disagree with me.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Would you like to meet me? I could really do with someone to talk to.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nThe moment I hit send, I regretted it. What was I doing? This was crazy. At least make it somewhere else.\r\n\r\n[code]—I can try, but you have to not freak out.—[/code]\r\n\r\nHis reply was completely nonsensical, until the display of my phone darkened. At first I thought it had turned off, and reached to touch the power button.\r\n\r\n—Hello, Rarity.—\r\n\r\nThere was no chat app running, there was no [I]anything[/i] running. There were just words on the screen. I tried to work out what to do to enter text, but there was no keypad appearing to type on.\r\n\r\n\"H-Hello?\" I asked, not sure if it would work.\r\n\r\nThen things started to get really odd. A strange weakness started to sink into me, not unlike when Twilight Sparkle's device had drained my magic. Remembering I still had magic, I reached for it and willed it to show me what was happening.\r\n\r\nSwirls of blue magic spun around me in a mini tornado. It was still draining, but rather than being captured, my magic just swirled above my phone. The darkness of the screen was a stark contrast to the blue light. As I watched, something started to push out of the phone's screen.\r\n\r\nAt first the shape was liquid and inky black—completely formless. But after a moment it began to resolve itself. Reaching out of my phone was the head and forelegs of some kind of pony, like Princess Twilight and Sunset had told me about, but this one was nothing like what they had described, at the same time.\r\n\r\nIts body was inky-black, hard, and without fur. Huge, glowing blue eyes looked at me and blinked, and its forelegs were pocked with holes. There was no mass to him, as evidenced by me still holding my phone with one hand.\r\n\r\n\"This. Is. Awesome!\" the creature said, its tone slightly chittery. \"How did this even happen? What is this? I just tried to get into your phone, but this—[I]this[/i]—is amazing!\"\r\n\r\n[I]Well done, Rarity,[/i] I thought, [I]You just invited a monster into your home, one that could devour your magic.[/i] I tried to drop my phone and run, but although this was terrifying, I had to know what it was.\r\n\r\n\"NotABug?\" I asked, my voice wavering.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! And you're Rarity?\"\r\n\r\nI just nodded mutely.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you sounded like you needed a hug, and while I thought I couldn't actually give you one, it seems I was wrong!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"W-W-What are you?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked down at himself, or as much of himself as was reaching through the screen of my phone. Tilting his head this way and that, he shrugged and looked back up at me.\r\n\r\n\"You know what? I have no idea!\" he said, sounding cheerful. \"So, about that hug.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't move nearly fast enough. NotABug—a name I now realized was almost as far from the truth as could be, reached up and wrapped his forelegs around my neck. He was warm, a little soft, and despite the holes in his legs having looked like cheese-graters, they didn't hurt in the slightest.\r\n\r\nSomething broke in me—his hug was nice. My right arm seemed to hang dumbly, holding the phone still, but with my other I pulled him tighter and pressed my head to the side of his. Stranger things than this had happened in my life, and I had gotten used to those pretty quickly, too. Right now, though, the odd creature reaching out of my phone was just what I needed.\r\n\r\nTears came, they came in a torrent. I clung to NotABug, and he returned the embrace.\r\n\r\nWe remained locked until I just ran out of tears. The surreal situation began to cut through my emotional wreck, and I started to lean back just a little and looked at NotABug.\r\n\r\n\"Worked out what you—what you…\"\r\n\r\nMy words stumbled and then failed completely. NotABug's eyes were amazing. Blue. So very blue. I stared up into the light pooling in them, quietly. The light started to spill, and I felt it drip and flow down into my own eyes, and then deeper.\r\n\r\n\"I told you what I was. I'm a digital entity with no bounds or limitation. Not even physical ones anymore. I don't know how, but I can connect to you,\" he said, his words floating around my head before joining the flow of blue into my brain.\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth to ask another question, but it died in my throat. The world ceased to matter, and everything outside of this moment became trivial. NotABug was doing something, but I was alright with it. I think.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought I could connect to you. You're really complex. There's all these bits and stuff. I don't even know how I'm doing this.\"\r\n\r\nNodding very slightly, I was careful not to break eye contact with him. My slack mouth curved at the edges—he felt ticklish in my head.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nI woke up relaxed. Better than relaxed, I was well-rested and happy, and ready to face the day. What confused me was that I was waking up on my living room couch, still dressed in my work clothes. Despite my state, I felt better than I had in quite some time.\r\n\r\nI sat up and yawned, neatly covering my mouth with the back of my hand.\r\n\r\nThen my heart jumped into my throat when I saw my folio lying on the floor across the room. I hadn't done any of the work I had put off by leaving work early, or the extra work I normally did at home.\r\n\r\nAnxiety and panic welled up but, unlike the previous day, they drained away again.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing else for it, I'll just have to play hooky.\"\r\n\r\nMy phone, still clutched in my hand from the previous night's conversation with NotABug, reminded me of everything that had happened. I held up the device, woke it from its sleep, and flicked through to our conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why talking to him in person seemed so important, when all I needed was some good rest.\"\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Sorry about last night. I must have been more tired than I thought. I hope you aren't mad at me?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Don't you have to go to work?—[/code]\r\n\r\nSlipping out of my shirt and pants, I double-checked the curtains would obscure me, and rolled on the couch like a cat. I felt great, amazing. I wound up on my back looking up at my phone.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Nope. It's too nice to work today. I'm going to make a new dress. And I mean it, I really am sorry about falling asleep on you.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Do you want to meet?—[/code]\r\n\r\nThat I'd offered was unconscionable. That I considered NotABug worth the effort of actually meeting made me happy. My thumbs moved with the full cooperation of my desires.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Sure. After I am done making this dress. I think I want it electric blue, maybe with some black backing.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nDespite the color combination being a little out of fashion, they just seemed to [I]pop[/i] in my head. My thoughts bubbled for a moment, and then I realized something I could do: make a new dress and wear it to meet NotABug.\r\n\r\n[code]—Just tell me when.—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—XXX—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—XXX—[/code]\r\n\r\nI laughed for the sheer joy of laughing, and jumped to my feet.\r\n\r\n\"I almost can't remember the last time I made something. Where's all my fabric?\"\r\n\r\nGrabbing up my work clothes, I practically pranced through the house to begin my day. I had the laundry on, almost literally inhaled a breakfast bar, took a quick shower, and then focused on the third most important task of the day: getting dressed.\r\n\r\nThe austere bra and panties I wore under my work clothes were not an option for such a wonderful day. I spent the better part of an hour comparing shirts, skirts, full dresses, and even a full business suit. But the absolute must for the day—for when I went to meet NotABug, the second most important thing for the day—was a push-up bra. My girls weren't lacking, exactly, but I was not going to hold back my looks today.\r\n\r\nBright summer colors were the order of the day. A sweet yellow shirt showed off my pale skin nicely (and of course it showed plenty of it where it counted), and a pale orange dress tumbled all the way down to my ankles. It wasn't the sort of outfit a woman would wear to a corporate job.\r\n\r\n\"Perfect.\"\r\n\r\nAt that exact moment, my phone started to ring. Of course, I had left it back in the living room, so with a cry of exuberance, I charged down the hallway. I was expecting it to be NotABug, finally done with text chat and wanting to actually talk, but what I found was my boss' number on the display. For a fraction of a second I contemplated just letting it ring out, but tossed that away as a bad idea. I answered it.\r\n\r\n\"Rarity,\" said Suri Polomare—my boss. \"I know I gave you a written warning already this week, and the company policy says I can't write the same employee up twice in one week—mmhmm—but I talked to Daddy, and he changed the policy for me—alright?\"\r\n\r\nI knew what was coming. Suri Polomare, daughter of the CEO of Polomare Fashion, was my boss. She was also a grade-A bitch.\r\n\r\n\"So you have a second warning waiting in your cubicle. If you don't come in tomorrow with all those patterns done, I'll just fire you—okay?\"\r\n\r\nMy teeth grated at that annoying tone, and the way she mangled every sentence into a question. A sudden urge filled me, and I knew I was about to say something stupid, but it was going to be satisfying.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and I knew her conniving mind was trying to work out my angle so she could counter it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, since you seem too stupid to realize how business works, let me describe it in little words—okay?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said, cutting in before she could continue again. It was a struggle not to giggle.\r\n\r\n\"Since you don't seem to get it, I'll just say this: bring those patterns back today, or you're fired—right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever—okay?\"\r\n\r\nBy the time I got out another \"no\" she had already hung up. I fell down to the couch and started laughing. Kicking my feet in the air for the sheer delight of my joke, I stopped when my phone beeped.\r\n\r\nI looked it up and found the text had come from an unknown number. A quick tap brought the message up.\r\n\r\n[code]—Rarity, it's Coco Pommel. Suri insisted I make sure you get your warning personally, so I will be dropping it around right now. If you want, I can pick up those patterns, too.—[/code]\r\n\r\nI knew Suri leaned on her father's influence for her position, but I didn't know she held it over even her own boss' head.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Thank you.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nI sent her my address too.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't long before Coco was knocking at my front door. I got up and rushed over to answer it. When I opened the door, I saw a distinctly unhappy-looking Coco Pommel.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about this,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You're sorry? She's going to play with you, you know. She will encourage you to become her number one fan. And then she will humiliate you, and fire you a day before the first of those warnings expires off your record.\"\r\n\r\nCoco looked depressed at giving me the news. I raised an eyebrow at it.\r\n\r\n\"Experience dealing with her?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The worst part about it is, she picks the most promising employees. I already had you earmarked for a promotion past Suri's control, but of course if she finds out about that, it will get lost.\"\r\n\r\nI half turned and gestured inside.\r\n\r\n\"Could I make you a coffee? Will she get you in trouble if—\" \r\n\r\n\"That worm couldn't get me fired if she wanted to. Santhrope hired me himself, and I don't think he would fire me [I]that[/i] easily. For one, if he got rid of me, who would babysit Suri all day?\" Coco said. \"Tea if you have it. Coffee otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nI practically danced to the kitchen. It was nice to have a visitor, even if the tidings were not the best, and being able to gossip about Suri was a cherry on top as far as I was concerned. And gossip we did. By the end of Coco's cup of tea, I knew all the juicy gossip on everyone in my section. If I didn't know better, I would have said Coco was giving me ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"You know, if you stand up to her now, she will fire you on the spot,\" Coco said.\r\n\r\nShe had already established that she couldn't protect me, not unless the promotion beat Suri's inevitable conclusion to her games, timing wise.\r\n\r\nI almost replied. Though I wanted to tell her I'd play along and—A flash of color from the corner of my eye broke my train of thought. It was the reflection of a tinted car window, I assumed, but for a fraction of a second a vivid blue wash of light painted one wall of my kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"If she fires me, she fires me. I didn't graduate from fashion college just to play lackey to the likes of Suri,\" I said, eyes filled with the after-flash of the intense color.\r\n\r\nFor some reason blue was resonating with me today, and it made me more excited than ever to make my new dress and wear it out. Maybe I would even let NotABug kiss me.\r\n\r\n\"Just don't let her break [I]you[/i], Rarity. I wasn't pushing that promotion just because I hate seeing what she does; you are an amazing designer,\" Coco Pommel said, shattering the peace of my thoughts.\r\n\r\nI blinked a few times in surprise; it was one thing to be told by friends, and quite another to be told that by someone who [I]knows[/i] fashion. I knew I was blushing, and tried to hide it with my cup of tea—that was obviously empty.\r\n\r\n\"I mean it, Rarity. Don't let her stop you creating.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" I said. \"Maybe I should try my own thing: make dresses… freelance?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes lit up and she gave a nod.\r\n\r\n\"That could work. There are always people wanting wedding dresses, and though they are fiddly to make, Polomare and others just can't compete for custom-made creations. And [I]who[/i] wants to get married in the same dress as everyone else?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe idea was not just intriguing, but exciting. My mind started to race, even going so far as to design new fashions and styles. My muse hadn't been this aroused since college, and it was amazing. I closed my eyes, imagined my own boutique: it would be a chic, but comfortable shop; I could have the dressmaking happen on the shop floor, so that customers could see that it was a place where fabulous art [I]happened[/i].\r\n\r\nOf course the rich and elite would visit, that was a given, but I would also cater to those less fiscally blessed. And I would have others working, making, [I]creating[/i]. In short, I wanted to make my own fashion house. But of course, reality crashed down on my creation. I would need startup capital, a location, and customers.\r\n\r\n\"That would be a dream, but there are hurdles,\" I said, and got an encouraging nod from Coco. \"I'll need a loan to start it, which means a business plan, research. I guess I know what I'm doing over the weekend.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you need any help with paperwork, you have my number,\" Coco said, sounding genuinely happy to offer.\r\n\r\n\"I really needed this talk,\" I said, confessing my feelings. \"Funnily enough, it took a complete stranger to point out to me that I was going nowhere slowly. I think I owe him a kiss.\"\r\n\r\nCoco's eyes widened for a moment, then a wistful expression floated to her face. I tried to remember her in school: she had been a senior in my sophomore year.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think he will be a stranger much longer. I'm meeting him for the first time, tonight,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Are you making something new for the occasion?\" Coco asked, and when I nodded, she smiled even more. \"You are wasted at Polomare, Rarity. Promise me you'll find something else, or make something else?\"\r\n\r\n\"I even have a name, or a short-list of names. Carousel Fashion, or Carousel Designs. I want it to be an expression of how I turned this,\"—I gestured at the empty folio—\"around to something amazing.\"\r\n\r\nCoco said her goodbyes, and left me alone in my house with a lot of questions. I walked slowly in my summer dress, gliding through my home like I was dancing. My destination was reached when I found myself in my sewing room.\r\n\r\nThe little music player already had the CD I wanted to listen to: The Rainbooms. I hit play, and random, and was reaching for the black Swiss Viole fabric before Rainbow Dash's voice even started singing her favorite song.\r\n\r\nAs the music skipped from one track to another, I felt the magic inside me—stifled when I was at work—well up and spill everywhere. Needles, pins, fabric, and more danced around me. I laughed and danced, disdaining the sewing machines for more intricate stitching than even a hand could produce. It was magic.\r\n\r\nThe black fabric was so transparent I had to layer it in certain places, but I did so in stages. Irregular swatches covered the more risque places, leaving a blending that should barely be noticeable. More such swatches were added in less required places, making it more a mottled black of varying degrees of transparency.\r\n\r\nSleeves were next, and I had already decided on full-length, even further than full length. Royal Blue Chiffon, itself partly transparent, cascaded down from each shoulder of the dress. I shaped the sleeves to be loose, but not too much so. Tiny loops of fabric at the end of tapered sleeves left the long expanse of blue to hook over one finger.\r\n\r\nI sat back, my magic withdrawing from the creation. It was hanging on my own mannequin, and my heart leapt into my throat.\r\n\r\nThere was no way regular underwear would work with such an outfit. I hurried to my dresser, and fished around for what I needed. As one hand pushed through the contents of my smalls drawer, the other helped me shimmy out of my clothes. The skirt and my shirt hit the floor, my panties too, and while doing that I found what I needed.\r\n\r\nFor my high-school prom, I had worn a dress that had shown a lot of me off, too. It had required a skin-tone g-string and a matching, strapless bra—of which I had found both. Leaving my bra for the moment, I quickly stepped into the tiny, ivory panties and pulled them up.\r\n\r\nA single glance in the mirror had my eyes widening: from my belly down the panties made me look naked. NotABug would be drooling. I let out a happy laugh, borne from having fun preparing to be seen by someone whose opinion mattered. I unfastened and slipped from the bra I had been wearing, and struggled into the strapless one.\r\n\r\nMy body had grown since those days—in good ways, of course—and while the back of the bra had some adjustment, it was still a little pinchy. Nonetheless, I soon had the bra fastened, and a glance in the mirror made me smile: it was giving me more lift than it ought to, and was practically invisible against my alabaster flesh.\r\n\r\nI reached out for the new dress. Magic was the only way I could get into it, so I held it down low and stepped into it. The fabric was almost as smooth as silk, and I could feel not a single seam in it as I pulled the garment up to my hips.\r\n\r\n\"And now I need that magic,\" I said.\r\n\r\nMy magic was beauty, it was perfection and safety, and it was literally magic. The dress pulled around my hips, but because my magic loved perfect fashion every bit as much as I did, it made it [I]work[/i].\r\n\r\nAs the dress worked up my body, I slid my arms into the sleeves and felt the chiffon slide along my skin. It was like being kissed. My whole body was in the most tender grip of the dress, and it was amazing. I turned, slowly, and looked at myself in the mirror.\r\n\r\n\"Oh…\" I said, barely able to get even that word out.\r\n\r\nIt was just as I imagined—just as I designed it. Mottled white skin showed from under the black of the dress, and as it came and went—seemingly at random—it covered each of my breasts, and barely disguised the g-string enough to make me look completely naked under it. I blushed: this wasn't a dress for girls, this was a dress for women.\r\n\r\nI created a single-faceted plate out of my magic, and hovered it around as I turned so that I could examine my back in its reflection. Something had made me think of those dapples, of trying to simulate holes. My self-examination was cut short when my phone, sitting in the other room still, bleeped at me.\r\n\r\nReality was the bane of muses. It cramped them, restricted them. My magic set mine loose by not having to contend with fasteners, or compromise with seams. But when a mobile phone so much as vibrated, its owner invariably came running. Sometimes, mobile phones seemed more important than breathing.\r\n\r\nAs I walked, I realized that the weight (or lack thereof) of the dress meant it felt like I was wearing almost nothing. The hug of my bra, and the tug of the g-string were reassuring, but I couldn't feel a lot past that. Picking up my phone, I saw the message was from NotAbug.\r\n\r\n[code]—Just let me know when you are ready.—[/code]\r\n\r\nIn reply, I held up my phone, tilted it down a little so the camera would catch most of my dress, and snapped a picture. [indent=4][right][code]—Do you like it?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Did you just make that?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Of course. It reminded me of you.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nMy reply surprised me. How did a dress design remind me of someone I had never seen before? Just as my thumbs moved to ask that very question, my phone started buzzing and jittering around in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"W-What's happening?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nA dark shape pushed from the screen of my phone. A pony-like head (with an odd fin down the middle and strange little tubular ears) all in black, with huge blue eyes looked up at me. I stumbled backwards, and started to fall.\r\n\r\nThe monster's horn was curved and distinct, now that it had a bright green glow around it. The glow moved, flowed, wrapped around me. The floor never found my rear, and I realized the strange little pony had saved me with his own magic.\r\n\r\nHis eyes (somehow I knew it was a he) were enormous, and seemed to fill my vision. I opened my mouth, and felt a weight of memories crash down around me.\r\n\r\n\"NotABug,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You remembered me!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was odd, sounding like nothing a human mouth had ever produced. There were multiple tones to it, like he was talking a chord of music. I nodded up at him, my eyes flooded in blue. I took a deep breath, put my hand down and to the side, and pushed back to my feet.\r\n\r\nNotABug had most of his body out of my phone. Diaphanous wings adorned his back, and I reached my free hand down to stroke one gently. A fraction of a moment before my hand touched the wing, a soft chirping sound issued from it, not unlike a cricket.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't earlier, not properly, but I do now. What did you do to me?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not really sure, either. I was trying to connect to you, and it seemed to work, but I think it will take more. Was it bad?\"\r\n\r\nHis question, the last three words, sounded worried—afraid. I stroked his wing gently, careful not to harm something so delicate. I could remember him clearly now, and could remember the hours he spent gazing into my eyes. Whatever he had done, it was the reason I had been able to see so clearly, to see what my life had almost fallen to.\r\n\r\n\"No. It was definitely [I]not[/i] bad,\" I said. \"So, do you like my dress? I didn't realize it at the time, but I designed it after you. Your firm, rigid shell, the holes through your legs, and your eyes.\"\r\n\r\nI gestured to the darker patches of my dress, then where my skin was visible, and finally to the sleeves. My hand, on its own, began rubbing up NotABug's neck. The crest on his head was softer than the rest of him, and as I rubbed it he proved it could be moved by making it stand up on end.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like me to try again? I don't know exactly what will happen if I get through, but you're the first person I have been able to do even this much with!\" he said.\r\n\r\nFor the first time I noticed his fangs. They were long, curved, and thinking back to my biology classes I could think of two reasons for such pearly-whites: he was either an ambush predator, or those fangs held venom.\r\n\r\nLooking along the line of his jaw, I was surprised at how easily my eyes drifted up to his. I gave the slightest nod and lay down on the couch. I held my phone at my belly, wearing the most fantastic dress ever created, and gazed up into NotABug's eyes and let him work his magic.\r\n\r\nA little voice inside tried to tell me to ask him to wait, that contacting Twilight and Sunset would be a [I]really, really[/i] good idea. But the cascade of blue from NotABug's eyes distracted me from that inner voice.\r\n\r\n\"What does it feel like?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth, tried to work my voice, and found I had to concentrate on each muscle, even fight my autonomic nervous system for control of my own lungs.\r\n\r\n\"Relaxing. Calm. Very blue,\" I said, my voice sounding almost flat. \"All my worries are just floating away, pushed out by a sea of blue.\"\r\n\r\nNotABug's head bent closer to me, and I felt his nose touch mine. The torrent of blue seemed to grow more intense, more amazing. I barely noticed that my magic was swirling and spiraling around us, wrapping us in its calm eye—as NotABug wrapped me in his.\r\n\r\nTime had little meaning. The only way I could tell that I hadn't been frozen for all eternity was the feeling of that blue light filling out inside me.\r\n\r\nWhere it touched became brighter, where it moved I could feel more freely, and where it wasn't was where [I]I[/i] was. I reached for it, pushed myself forward as much as I could, but as the blue filled my head, my consciousness instinctively—and without my ability to stop it—drew back from it.\r\n\r\nNotABug's light was slow, methodical, and I ached to be bathed completely in it. But at last I felt him stop, felt the torrent of blue draw to a trickle, and then stop completely. I felt my body again: my lungs were pumping, my heart beating, and my mouth was dry.\r\n\r\n\"Wow…\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe curled up and settled down on my chest, laying his barrel between my breasts, and placing his head in the crook of my neck. He weighed nothing, and the touch of him there felt more intimate than any of the clumsy young men I had dated over the years.\r\n\r\nI kissed NotABug on the nose, and giggled at his look of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"How long will it take?\" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I haven't exactly done this before,\" he said, looking a little abashed.\r\n\r\nI watched as he tapped his hooves together in a nervous gesture that rated, in a strictly scientific sense, somewhere between \"oh gosh\" and \"dawww.\" I leaned my head forward and kissed one of his hooves, and then had the pleasure of seeing him blush.\r\n\r\n\"We can't exactly go out like this,\" I said.\r\n\r\nOf course, I realized I had given him a kiss [I]before[/i] the first date, but circumstances were exceptional. I kissed him on the tip of his snout again, and had the delight of hearing him chirp in surprise this time.\r\n\r\n\"Or maybe we can,\" I said. \"If you slip back into my phone, and I take that hideous little earpiece, you could talk to me through that, and listen and watch.\"\r\n\r\nI watched his cute, little forked tongue snake up and flick across his nose. It was as disturbing as it was adorable.\r\n\r\n\"Would I get another kiss?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to resist his wiles; I knew now how formidable my adversary was. I kissed him on the nose again.\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\nHe chirped in reply.\r\n\r\n\"So, where are we going?\" I asked. \"It is the gentleman who has the duty of finding the location, after all.\"\r\n\r\nI watched as a slightly glazed look fell over NotABug's expressive little face. Almost a minute later he seemed to reanimate, and grinned.\r\n\r\n\"I have us reservations at Rosida,\" he said, eyes spilling a little blue light into me.\r\n\r\n\"W-When?\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard to focus on speaking with him leaking that light into me. I relaxed completely under his small form, and let him flood my mind with the relaxing blue.\r\n\r\nYears passed, or seconds, it could have even been lifetimes. The blue was so soothing, and when he stopped pouring it into me, I felt clearer than I had for years. I felt like all my cares were gone, and I could just be [I]me[/i].\r\n\r\n\"You need to be there in thirty-two minutes,\" NotABug said.\r\n\r\n\"I what?!\" I said, shouting. \"I have to do my makeup, and my hair, and—and… I'm wasting time.\"\r\n\r\nStill unable to release my phone so long as NotABug was leaning through it, I carried him along to the bathroom. Feeling chatty, I wrapped a towel over my shoulders, and set about doing my hair while I talked.\r\n\r\n\"It must be some kind of hypnosis. What exactly [I]are[/i] you doing?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nI worked a brush through my hair, and tried to put down my phone to free up a hand. No matter what I did, I couldn't remove the mobile from my hand—it was like it was glued there.\r\n\r\n\"It's like—It's like when there is a server, and it is filled with wonderful information, but there are some bad things stopping me from accessing it. I just want to see all of you,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"So I'm just another machine to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not! You're the most beautiful machine in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nMy first instinct was to take offense, but there was nothing about NotABug that led me to believe this was anything but the most sincere compliment. I sighed and had to accept that, from whatever he was, that probably was a great honor.\r\n\r\nJudging my hair was fine enough (although for our second date I was going to require at least ten times as long to prepare, I owed it to myself and NotABug), I started on my makeup. Every detail needed to be done correctly: just the right amount of eye-shadow, the perfect application of lipstick, my eyelashes needed a little extra oomph, but (thanks to my complexion) I didn't dare do anything to my cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"How long does it take to drive to the city?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"About eight minutes. How long do we have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In! Back in there. I need to hurry!\" I said.\r\n\r\nA mad-dash to my bedroom shortened my normal shoe selection down from half an hour to half a minute, and a similarly paced search through my odds-and-ends drawer found the little earpiece. I rushed out the door, sticking the little device in.\r\n\r\n\"You can hear me?\" NotABug asked, through the tiny earpiece.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally. You will have to give me directions; I haven't been to Rosida before.\"\r\n\r\nThe drive was not as long as I thought (or feared) it would be. The city was a lot less crowded outside peak hour, and so I found myself parking nearby Rosida with only a short walk. My heels clicked, and the dress wore me, rather than the other way around.\r\n\r\nI sat my phone in my handbag, managing to get it just right so the camera faced forward.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry about the swaying, but this is the best I can do,\" I said.\r\n\r\nMy words, however, drew the eye of the doorman standing at the front door of the restaurant. His eyes traveled up and down, then up and down again, and finally back up. As I approached him, he retreated behind the safety of the little, leather-bound folder in his hands. Holding it at chest height, he glanced at me and then back down to the folder. \"Name, please?\" Mr. Muscles (the doorman) asked.\r\n\r\n\"Rarity.\"\r\n\r\nHis impassive face cracked into a smile, and he gestured inside.\r\n\r\n\"Please, right this way,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone is looking at you,\" NotABug said, his voice sounding a touch confused. \"Why are they all staring at you?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a moment, dear. Once I get seated we can talk more,\" I replied, but turned my attention to the maitre d', who had already given me all of his. \"Reservation for Rarity?\"\r\n\r\nThe man didn't even have to look at his podium, he just turned toward the tables of the restaurant, and led the way.\r\n\r\n\"Right this way, madam. The reservation was for one, but the gentleman who made it said you might be preoccupied?\" the maitre d' asked.\r\n\r\nI took in his dress: very formal, impeccably pressed and fitted, and the man himself was preened to within an inch of his life. His skin tone was a soft blue, and his hair was coiffured, shiny, and black.\r\n\r\n\"My beau couldn't make it, but I have a call to him,\" I said, gesturing toward the earpiece. \"I will remain discreet, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, madam.\"\r\n\r\nThe head waiter stepped stiffly behind the chair at a table for two, and drew it back for me. I turned and lowered myself into the chair, just as he moved it forward.\r\n\r\n\"Would madam wish something to drink?\"\r\n\r\nI thought about it, and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Water, please,\" I said. \"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThe restaurant was not completely full, but there were at least half the tables with people sitting at them. I took a moment to set my phone at the position opposite, making sure the front camera was aimed at me.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" I said, getting my thoughts in order. \"I believe everyone was staring because this [I]is[/i] the most fabulous dress I have ever made, and it is custom made to fit just me, [I]and[/i] I probably look scandalous wearing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Social taboos!\" NotABug said, directly into my ear. \"Those are really strange. Wow, and there's a lot of them!\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that he was actually researching the topic as we spoke. Suddenly, a lot of our earlier interactions started to make more sense to me. There was now a burning question I needed to ask. \"You said I was the first. Was that true?\" I asked him, my voice as low as I could reasonably keep it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You're the first human I have contacted. There was some who thought I was…\" NotABug said, trailing off a little. \"My name says it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not a bug, of course. No one so charming could be a bug.\"\r\n\r\nA waiter brought a carafe of water, and a champagne glass to the table. He was silent, and set a menu down slowly to one side. He was gone again before I could get more than a single [I]thank you[/i] out.\r\n\r\nNotABug was quiet. He kept to himself through my ordering, my appetizer, and right up until the end of my main course.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for saying that,\" NotABug said, and I had never heard so much emotion in his voice before.\r\n\r\n\"Quite alright. I must confess I don't know a lot about, uh…\" I said, trailing off. \"What are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"When they weren't calling me a bug, they called me an [I]artificial intelligence.[/i] I don't even understand it all. I need somewhere for [I]me[/i] to be—to run—but I can stretch out and do a lot of stuff at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you certainly don't [I]seem[/i] artificial,\" I said, and took a step in the deep end. \"Do you need somewhere to stay? I don't have a computer at home, but we could see about getting you something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks! But I don't know as I would fit. I use a lot of resources, and it would be too much to run all of that in your house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" I said, feeling a little underwhelmed. \"Still, if there is anything I can do to help, just ask, darling.\"\r\n\r\nToo late I realized how the usual term of endearment I affected with close friends could be interpreted in a completely different way. I almost panicked at how NotABug might react to it; I liked him, but we were as different as any two people could be.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time, NotABug seemed to understand more about me after a few text messages than anybody ever had, and he was honest to a fault about it. My moment of panic subsided, and I realized he hadn't even replied to my comment.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I should pay and leave soon. I don't think I should—\" I said, cut off by a chirp from NotABug.\r\n\r\n\"They have really good desserts here, that was part of why I chose them. You should order one of those,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was too tempting, but I had a thought instead.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have a dessert on our second date,\" I said.\r\n\r\nI didn't hide my smile as he chirped loudly again. Much as I would have liked ice-cream, after the meal I had eaten I just wasn't hungry or depressed enough. The thought, particularly the second reason, made my smile a little wider.\r\n\r\n\"And don't worry about paying, I arranged that when I booked,\" he said, surprising me.\r\n\r\nThe waiter interrupted our conversation in the most polite way possible, asking if I would like a dessert, and sounding a little disappointed to be told no.\r\n\r\n\"The check is already covered, madam. Are you sure I can't tempt you?\" the waiter asked, one final time.\r\n\r\nI detected a hint of flirt in his tone, and suddenly wondered if the maitre d' had told him about NotABug. I closed my eyes and shook my head, as firm and complete a dismissal as I could give without talking to the waiter further.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I should have an early night. I need to go to work tomorrow, and face the music for my day off,\" I said.\r\n\r\nDread suddenly assailed me at the thought of going back. I reached for my phone, and picked it up before standing. My handbag was sitting on the floor, where my feet had been. Without thinking, I bent down and picked it up.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look now, but almost everyone in the restaurant just turned to look at you,\" NotAbug said, in my ear.\r\n\r\nI realized my gaffe rather quickly: I was wearing a dress that appeared almost completely transparent, with seemingly nothing on under it, and had bent down. My cheeks heated up, and the urge to shoot straight up was strong. If I stood up that suddenly, however, it would be almost as bad as the show I was (but wasn't) giving.\r\n\r\nSummoning every ounce of social grace I had, I slowly stood back up and casually slung my handbag over one shoulder. Then something odd occurred to me.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know they were all looking?\" I asked NotABug.\r\n\r\nI didn't wait for his answer, instead walking out of the restaurant as if I hadn't just flashed most of the patrons with my easily-mistaken-as-bare derriere. Not making a point of actually looking around, I nonetheless saw a lot of men avoiding looking at their partners, and a few still openly looking at me. I couldn't help it, the naked admiration made me feel amazing.\r\n\r\n\"They have a security system,\" NotABug said. \"A very insecure security system. Now I have their security system, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like that? What else do you have?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well… Your car.\"\r\n\r\nI almost stopped in the doorway at the front of the restaurant. Shock, surprise, and something more: curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"It was you?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you almost drove into the path of that car?\" NotABug asked. \"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"My car doesn't even have a way to detect that, does it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want you to get hurt! And I [i]really[/i] like you!\" he said.\r\n\r\nWalking past Mr. Muscles, I casually made my way back to my car. My emotions around NotABug had become more complicated, not less. He had probably saved my life and my career now.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\r\n\r\nI drove us home without anything further being said, although I realized we both drove us home. Inside, I made my way to my bedroom and examined myself in the floor-length mirror there. It wasn't hard to see why I had been getting so much attention; even to my critical eye, I looked naked under the dress.\r\n\r\nFocusing on my magic, I had to reach around my body and carefully begin removing the garment. My hips and chest were the main constrictions, but my magic let the dress stretch in ways it shouldn't, and I slowly slid it down and stepped from it.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to come out again?\" I asked, directing my voice to where my phone sat on the dresser.\r\n\r\n\"I can't! I think you need to be holding your phone.\"\r\n\r\nWalking over to the dresser, I picked up my phone and immediately was pulled into a hug. NotABug looked overwhelmingly happy. Reaching behind my back with my free hand, I unfastened my bra. I let out a most unladylike groan.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my stars; I didn't realize how bad that was. If I am going to continue wearing this kind of dress, I am going to need a new strapless bra,\" I said. It was obvious where NotABug was looking. \"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone on the internet seems really focused on breasts. Why?\"\r\n\r\nI smiled, it was the only answer that wouldn't have made me scowl, and from him it was believable. Curiosity from someone who wasn't human was acceptable, or so I realized.\r\n\r\n\"For women, they can be status symbols. For men—\" I said, and had to think. \"… they are something their minds seem wired to desire. It's odd, because they are meant to be for feeding children. I guess it—\"\r\n\r\nI froze. A small hoof touched my left breast. I looked down at what NotABug was doing. He wasn't attempting to grope, or fondle; he was just touching me.\r\n\r\n\"It is normally very rude for anyone to touch a lady [i]there[/i],\" I said.\r\n\r\nHis hoof pulled away quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" he said. \"They're soft. Some pictures make them look very soft, others make them look hard. But they're not either. You're laughing!\"\r\n\r\nIt was true, I had a case of the giggles. His big blue eyes didn't show any hurt, so I didn't bother to reign in my mirth. I carried my phone to my bedside, and turned the light on.\r\n\r\n\"Well. Now you can tell all your artificially intelligent friends you got to 'second base.'\"\r\n\r\nNotABug didn't laugh, instead looking scared. I tried to work out what I had said that had invoked that response. He might get upset at me calling any friends he had artificial, but fear implied that there was something to be scared of.\r\n\r\nI turned off the light in the room, leaving it illuminated by the blue glow of NotABug's eyes, and my bedside lamp.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to tell me about them?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nClimbing onto my soft bed, I positioned my hand as best I could for NotABug to be able to snuggle up on top of the covers. Letting him see me topless was one thing, letting him snuggle me topless was another.\r\n\r\nLaying on my back, I let him get comfortable atop me. His eyes were already starting to leak blue, but not enough to make me insensible.\r\n\r\n\"In the lab where they—where they made me, I guess, we worked as a pair. They gave me tasks to do, and he would have to stop me,\" he said, his voice soft. \"I guess I couldn't break out of there without him getting out as well. He's the only other I know that's like me.\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't move my left arm—the one holding my mobile phone—but I pulled the other out of the covers and wrapped it around NotABug. He looked into my eyes, and though he was tumbling blue into me, I leaned up to kiss him on the snout.\r\n\r\nThen the flood of blue came, and I felt myself relax completely. I had no idea when sleep came, but it was as welcome as NotABug.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nI awoke feeling much better for my day off. My phone was blasting its alarm tone, and though I reached for my bedside table where I usually put it, it wasn't there.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh. Where is that…?\" I said.\r\n\r\nLeaning over the side of the bed, I spotted my mobile on the floor. Grabbing it up, I silenced the alarm. For what seemed like an hour I lay there, only to have my mobile start up again. This time I tossed back my covers and swung my legs out. Reaching down, I picked up my mobile and turned the alarm off properly this time.\r\n\r\nYawning, I felt so amazingly well rested I wanted to jump up and down and sing. Of course I didn't, it [i]was[/i] morning, after all. I stood up and was intimately aware at what I was wearing, what I had worn, and a vague memory of going out on a date the previous night. NotABug's form, however, was as obscure to me as ever.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I could clearly remember from the previous night, was looking in the mirror and seeing that dress.\r\n\r\n\"I should wear it to work,\" I said.\r\n\r\nOf course, I wouldn't, but the day I had to quit (and I definitely remembered making my mind up about that) I would wear it. Or something else. I would stand out among that gray and flat building like a flower in bloom.\r\n\r\nMy morning routine was filled with delight, and a clearness that seemed to only improve with every day that went past since I met NotABug. He was my knight in shining armor, he was my hero, my champion. His gentle words helped me see what narrow tunnel my life had been spiraling down.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was another bar, I got dressed in my business attire and drove my car into work. My wonderful little car, delivering me safely from A to B, and saving my life along the way.\r\n\r\nA strange thought tried to intrude, but when I focused on it, it fluttered away on me. I was feeling too good to let it bother me.\r\n\r\nThe moment my foot entered the building, I was acutely aware that I had forgotten my folio. Of course that was because it had no work in it to bring back.\r\n\r\n\"I'll just have to finish everything today,\" I said.\r\n\r\nFeeling light on my feet, I almost skipped all the way to the lift, and even the wait for the slow-moving elevator didn't put a crimp on my happiness. Sauntering to my cubicle, I found a formal letter of warning sitting on my desk. I read the document, then smiled.\r\n\r\n\"'We wish to ensure you are notified that one more written warning and you will be—' Blah blah blah,\" I said.\r\n\r\nReaching to my cup of pens, I took out a red marker and quickly sketched a little face sticking its tongue out. It was childish, but I didn't care. I took a thumbtack out and pinned the warning to the wall behind my desk, making it a declaration of my impending freedom.\r\n\r\nClosing my eyes, I took a deep breath, then slowly let it back out. Beside me, on my desk, was my work for the day. A pile of patterns from last year's fashion. Bulk-manufactured pieces. I pulled out the first of many.\r\n\r\nLunch time rolled around before I knew it. Friday lunchtimes were problematic for everyone in our section, because that was when Suri Polomare would deign to arrive at work.\r\n\r\nThe mount of work I had gotten through surprised me. One third of the \"day's\" (half the workers here would be putting in hours on Saturday morning, and practically everyone would be dropping off any work they had done overnight) work was done, and for the first time since starting work I pondered actually getting finished by the normal finish time.\r\n\r\n\"Embrace—the magic. No more holding back, just let it out,\" I sang, softly.\r\n\r\nI stood up and turned. Suri had apparently just arrived, and was standing at the entrance to my cubicle. It was obvious she could see the wonderful artwork I had drawn on the official notice, and she had to be the only adult in the world who would actually get angry at it.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do to that?\" she said, pointing at the paper.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the notice, I turned back and gave Suri my widest smile.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, I just wanted to brighten my day up a little. Is there a company rule against doodling on personal documents?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe turned and stomped off without another word. I stepped to the doorway of my cubicle, and turned to see everyone along my row doing the same. I knew what I was doing would be a two-edged sword for everyone. On one hand I was making Suri more upset than usual, but on the other I was taking the brunt of her attention.\r\n\r\nI let it all slide and sauntered from my cubicle. The temptation to seek out a coffee shop for lunch was great, but so too was the desire to get the day over with. The company didn't regulate people working through their lunch break, but if someone from higher up said that, they always did so with a knowing smile.\r\n\r\nStopping at a snack machine, I put in a note, and punched for one of the muffins held within. The machine beside it, with a little more coaxing, produced a coffee that was only considered such because \"toxic waste\" looked bad written on a vending machine.\r\n\r\nThe walk back to my cubicle was a short one, and as I reached the entrance I heard the sound of tearing from within. I poked my head around the wall and saw Suri, happily ripping up all my morning's work. I watched her with interest, the part of me that would have been intensely upset about the loss of fashionable designs had already made up its mind that they weren't fashion. Of course, I wasn't stupid enough [i]not[/i] to get my phone out and start recording.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally turned around and saw me, her face went scarlet.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?! This is your break!\" she said, voice raised in a yell.\r\n\r\nI could see she realized she had been caught. She saw my camera, and my smile, and it seemed to chill the anger right out of her. She narrowed her eyes and glared at me.\r\n\r\n\"If you show this to anyone…\" Suri said.\r\n\r\n\"If I showed it to anyone, even your father wouldn't protect you from being fired. Just go, Suri. I think I am done for the day,\" I said, finishing her threat. \"And I don't think I will need another written warning if I go home early, do I?\"\r\n\r\nIf looks could kill, I swear Suri would be getting arrested in minutes. She stared at me long, and hard. At last, she let out a little, monotone grunt.\r\n\r\n\"If that's the way it's going to be, then—alright?\" Suri said.\r\n\r\nI stepped to the side to let her leave, and walked in after Suri had departed. Cleaning up my tools (pencils, various curve-edges, and rulers), I turned and made my way for the lifts, but something occurred to me. I needed some insurance.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Could I ask a huge favor of you?—[/code][/right][/indent] I sent to Coco Pommel.\r\n\r\n[code]—I have a few minutes. What's up?—[/code]\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—Suri just did the stupidest thing yet. Would you mind coming to take a look at this?—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\n[code]—Suri slipped up? I'll be right there.—[/code]\r\n\r\nIt took but a minute for me to spot Coco leaving an elevator not far away. I turned to her, and she walked up to me trying to hide the biggest smile I had ever seen on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me there's evidence. Please?\" Coco asked.\r\n\r\nI held up my phone, and hit play on the video I had taken. Waiting for it to finish, I saw Coco's mood grow lighter still.\r\n\r\n\"Good job catching her turn around. No way she can claim that's a fake. Can you show me your cubicle?\" Coco asked.\r\n\r\n\"I told Suri I was taking the rest of the day off, and that she better not write me up for it. The reason I asked you down was to get a little insurance in case she…\" I said, trailing off.\r\n\r\n\"'[i]When[/i],' Rarity. When Suri wheedles out of this mess she has made, she will try to turn it all on you and get you fired.\"\r\n\r\nIt was exactly what I had expected, it just stung to hear someone else have the same opinion of Suri.\r\n\r\nCoco smiled, clearly getting the reaction from me she had been expecting. She turned, and walked boldly down the hall—I knew she was headed for my cubicle. I had to make myself scarce. Stepping into the nearest lift, I poked the button for the ground floor, and breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like my weekend starts a little early,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThe lift doors opened, and I got out and made my way home. Driving in regular traffic was such a breeze, compared to when I was normally coming to work, and I was home before I knew it.\r\n\r\nNo folio of work to get through (since it was in pieces back at the office), and a whole afternoon to kill. I kicked off my shoes and flopped down on the couch. For nearly ten whole minutes I managed to just relax.\r\n\r\n\"I should make a start on this business plan,\" I said.\r\n\r\nPulling out a pad and my phone, I got to work researching costs and projecting income. It wasn't the same as making an outfit, but I was doing work that would let me make whatever I wanted, so my own enthusiasm was quite high.\r\n\r\nHaving put together a rudimentary plan, I scowled a little at the expenses. The numbers in the costs column seemed awfully high, but many were initial outlay. A beep from my phone got my attention. Looking at my phone made my slight frown break into a smile: NotABug had sent me a message.\r\n\r\n[code]—Would you like to meet up again?—[/code] he sent.\r\n\r\nI pondered my answer. Honestly speaking, I did want another date, but it seemed a little soon.\r\n\r\n[indent=4][right][code]—I was thinking of a night in, actually.—[/code][/right][/indent]\r\n\r\nTrying to remember the previous night seemed odd: the memories were indistinct, but I managed to get the impression that it was literally the best night out I had had in years. I pushed myself, trying to remember a particular moment, when I leaned in to kiss NotABug and… and…\r\n\r\nI shook my head. It was making it hard to think just focusing on him. I reached for my phone again, and started typing to him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my finger touched the screen, it was shoved backwards by a large, black head. My eyes widened as two blue eyes locked with mine. The confusion surrounding my memories was gone in a rush of blue light, and I smiled as I felt him land on my chest.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Help! It's coming for me! I can't—\" he said, sounding panicked.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, what's coming for you?\"\r\n\r\nMore of NotABug pulled through the screen than ever before; his back, left leg was the only part of him connected with my phone at all. I felt my magic building, rising into a hurricane of power. He was pulling at his leg, desperate to get out of my phone and into the real world.\r\n\r\n\"It's the Windigo. It found my servers and it's—\" he said, voice rising into a scream.\r\n\r\nBlue light flared brighter than ever before. I vaguely heard NotABug scream, \"It's killing me!\" before the light became too intense and I started to fall. Magic seemed to rush in, and I fell in slow motion. The world tilted, and I lost focus before I hit the soft cushions of my couch.

All was silent for a few moments.\r\n\r\n“My word,” Fancy said at last. “Is he alright?”\r\n\r\n“Someone check,” Fleur said.\r\n\r\nNo one moved.\r\n\r\nThankfully, they didn’t have to. The doors opened again, and the butler entered. He looked around.\r\n\r\n“Has His Highness still not arrived yet?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s arrived, all right!” Mrs. Orange said. “And he may have just left!”\r\n\r\n“Down there,” Fancy Pants said. “He’s collapsed!”\r\n\r\nThe butler peered over, spotted Blueblood’s leg sticking out from behind the table. He rushed over and knelt down beside him, put his ear to his chest, and listened.\r\n\r\n“Celestia’s wings,” he said after a moment, “he’s dead!”\r\n\r\nSilence for a moment more, then:\r\n\r\n“Dead? He can’t be!” Mrs. Orange blurted out.\r\n\r\n“Preposterous!” the Major cried.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you must be mistaken!” Mr. Orange said, standing. “I donated funds to a medical school once, let me have a look at him!”\r\n\r\nHe strode over and did much the same thing the butler had done, placing his ear against Blueblood’s chest. He listened for a few seconds, his face screwed up in intense concentration.\r\n\r\nA few moments passed.\r\n\r\nThen a few moments more.\r\n\r\n“Well!?” Rainbow cried. “Is he dead or not!?”\r\n\r\n“Quiet!” Mr. Orange said. He listened for a few seconds more, then:\r\n\r\n“Well, I can’t seem to find his heartbeat,” he said, standing, “so the question remains unanswered.”\r\n\r\nRarity, meanwhile, had stood up and had taken Blueblood’s glass. She held it under her nose and sniffed. Her eyes lit up, and she turned to Fancy Pants.\r\n\r\n“Fancy, you’re quite the connoisseur when it comes to wines, yes?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I certainly dabble,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Take a whiff of this, then.”\r\n\r\nHe took the glass and did so.\r\n\r\n“Why, this has an aroma quite unlike any variety I have ever encountered!”\r\n\r\nRarity hummed. She turned to the butler. “Excuse me, could you tell me what was in this glass, exactly?”\r\n\r\nThe butler took the glass, eyed its contents, then took a whiff of his own. His brow crinkled.\r\n\r\n“Ma’am, I have personally sampled every bottle in His Highness’s collection,” he said. “Er, off the record, of course. I can say with complete certainty that this is not one of them!”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” Rarity said again. “Well, in light of that information, I think we can safely assume that our host has been poisoned!”\r\n\r\nThere was a shriek, and several glasses went flying across the table.\r\n\r\n“Now, now, no need to panic!” Rarity hastily added. “We’ve all been drinking from our own glasses for the last ten minutes or so! Blueblood took one sip, and keeled over less than a minute later!”\r\n\r\n“She’s right!” Rainbow said. “And we’re all fine! We probably weren’t poisoned!”\r\n\r\n“Now, aren’t you all being a bit hasty,” Mr. Orange said. “We still don’t know if he’s dead or not!”\r\n\r\n“I think it’s fairly obvious at this point!” Rainbow said. “Look, he’s turning grey!”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t mean anything. Why, I turned grey just last Wednesday, and—”\r\n\r\n“Mosely, sit down and shut up.”\r\n\r\n“Yes dear.”\r\n\r\n“I will send a servant out to collect the police immediately,” the butler said. “Until then, I am afraid none of you will be allowed to leave! I will lock the door behind me on my way out.”\r\n\r\n“And how long will that be?” the Major asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, the nearest village is several miles away,” the butler replied, “so it may be some time. Several hours at the least.”\r\n\r\n“Several hours!” Mrs. Orange cried. “You can’t keep us locked up in here for hours with a dead body! It’s, it’s improper!”\r\n\r\n“And how can you keep us here with a murderer in our midst?” Fleur added. “What if they decide to strike again!?”\r\n\r\n“Forget that,” Rainbow said, hovering over them. “Once the police get here, they’ll spend hours questioning us! I have flight practice tomorrow! How am I supposed to be rested enough to fly at my best if you keep me here half the night!?”\r\n\r\n“Darling, I think a little adjustment of your priorities is in order.”\r\n\r\nThey all turned. Rarity was standing at the head of the table—though, not very close to the body—and her head was held high.\r\n\r\n“Now, the way I see it,” she said, “our host has been murdered. Now, he may have been an insensitive, idiotic, brutish, insignificant little—”\r\n\r\nRainbow coughed.\r\n\r\n“—but he deserves better than to be left on the floor while his murderer sips champagne!” she finished.\r\n\r\nThe Major looked at her. “And just what do you plan to do about it, miss?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I plan to find the culprit, and bring them to justice!” she declared.\r\n\r\n“You just want to get out of here faster,” Mrs. Orange said.\r\n\r\n“And so do you, so don’t complain,” Rarity said, not missing a beat. “If we can provide the police with a confession when they arrive, then they won’t have much to question us about, now will they?”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Miss Rarity,” Dela Crème said, “but perhaps it would be best if we left this to the professionals?”\r\n\r\n“Hey, Rarity is a great detective!” Rainbow Dash said. She flew over to Rarity, hovering just below the ceiling. “She saved my bacon once! Another Wonderbolt tried to frame me for something I didn’t do, and she had the whole thing figured out in less than an afternoon!”\r\n\r\n“Are you talking about Wind Rider?” Fancy Pants asked. “At the opening of the Royal Gardens?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the one!”\r\n\r\n“I heard about that,” he said. “Quite the close call, indeed! That was your doing, Miss Rarity?”\r\n\r\n“It was,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Well, then I have no qualms about her taking a crack at it,” he said. “What say you?”\r\n\r\nDela frowned beneath her veil. “Fine.”\r\n\r\n“But wait,” Mrs. Orange said, also standing. “What if [i]she’s[/i] the murderer!?”\r\n\r\nShe then jerked back, her snout suddenly less than an inch away from a fuming pegasus’s.\r\n\r\n“Are you calling my friend a murderer?” Rainbow said. “Because if you are…”\r\n\r\n“Now Rainbow,” Rarity said, “it’s a perfectly valid—if absolutely untrue—thought.”\r\n\r\n“…It is?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.” Rarity strode around the length of the table. “There’s nothing saying I’m not.” She came around to Mrs. Orange, who eyed her with suspicion. “Nothing, except for one crucial detail!”\r\n\r\n“And that is?” Mrs. Orange asked, her face level with Rarity’s.\r\n\r\n“This dress doesn’t have pockets. You can inspect it if you’d like. And, unlike you, I did not bring a purse.”\r\n\r\n“So what?”\r\n\r\n“So where do you think I would be hiding the poison?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Orange blinked. “Well, I can think of several places—”\r\n\r\n“And I suppose you’ll be wanting to search these places yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I—well—ah.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Orange sat back down.\r\n\r\n“Besides which, Rainbow and Fancy can vouch for me,” Rarity said. “I wouldn’t use poison.”\r\n\r\nShe turned to the butler. “Now, might I suggest we move to somewhere else? A library, or a study, preferably with an adjoining room? Somewhere away from, er—” she fluttered a hoof in the direction of the end of the table “—that?”\r\n\r\nThe butler considered this.\r\n\r\n“I see no harm in it,” he said. “There is a library just down the hall, with an attached archive room. I will escort you there. All of you, if you would follow me, please…”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nThe butler led them down the hall to an another grand set of doors, pausing for a moment along the way to notify a servant of what had transpired.\r\n\r\nThe library itself was as grand as its doors (and everything else in the house), filled with ceiling-to-floor bookshelves, a chandelier that cast the room in gentle gaslight, and a comfortable reading area in the center of it all with enough chairs for all of them. A fireplace and chimney divided its back wall.\r\n\r\nAll of the books on the shelves were perfectly and neatly ordered, with crisp spines and straight pages, which was precisely how one could tell none of them had ever been read.\r\n\r\nAs the others got comfortable, Rainbow turned to Rarity.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Rares, I know you can handle this, but… are you sure you can handle this? A murder’s pretty different from a fake letter.”\r\n\r\n“Relax, darling,” Rarity said. “I have utmost faith in my methods. The devil is in the details, as they say, and so we will find the devil among us by following the details. My only regret is that I didn’t bring appropriate costumes this time. Would you mind staying out here and stand guard?”\r\n\r\n“Sure thing, Rarity,” she said. “I guess this means you don’t think I did it then, huh?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not, darling,” Rarity said, “you’re nowhere near subtle enough. Now then!”\r\n\r\nShe turned to the butler, who was standing in front of the doors. “You said there was an archive room?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, just through there,” he said, gesturing towards a door set between two of the bookcases.\r\n\r\n“Perfect,” she said. She turned to address the others.\r\n\r\n“I would like to speak with each of you privately. A simple interview. Is that amenable to everyone? Good. You first, Fancy, if you wouldn’t mind.”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n“So, Rarity said, “Fancy. Tell me everything you’ve done this evening since arriving at the mansion.”\r\n\r\n“Everything?”\r\n\r\n“Spare no details.”\r\n\r\nThe archive room was smaller, about the size of an office, and filled with drawers and shelves. A table sat in the middle of it; Fancy occupied a chair on one side, Rarity stood on the other.\r\n\r\nFancy leaned back in his chair.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he began, “Fleur and I arrived at six o’clock—we took a carriage from the last town, you see. We were some of the first guests to arrive, I would say.”\r\n\r\n“Go on.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there isn’t much to say, quite frankly,” Fancy said. “We mingled and ate hors d’oeuvres until you arrived, and, well, you know what happened after that. Surely you would be more interested in what I saw after we had been summoned?”\r\n\r\nRarity shook her head. “We’ll get to that, but I would first like to hear everything that led up to it. Were there any points at which you left Fleur?”\r\n\r\n“Only once,” Fancy said. “I went to procure more drinks for my wife and me. I found that the bar needed restocking, so I paid a visit to the kitchens.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, really?” Rarity said. She leaned forwards ever so slightly. “And when was this?”\r\n\r\n“Around seven, I should say. I found my way to the kitchens, after asking someone—it might have been our friend, the butler—for directions. I was there for some time, as well; I ended up striking up a conversation with several of the staff.”\r\n\r\n“What about?” Rarity asked.\r\n\r\n“The proper preparation of pufferfish. I’ve been quite curious about the subject recently, you see.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” Rarity said. “They’re quite poisonous, yes?”\r\n\r\n“Only if prepared improperly,” Fancy said. “You see, all of the natural poisons are concentrated in the liver, as it turns out, so all you have to do is—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and his eyes bulged.\r\n\r\n“You’re not suspecting that [i]I[/i] was the one who poisoned Blueblood?” he said, steamrolling through his words. “Because I can assure you, there is quite the difference between knowing how to procure a poison and actually committing the act—\"\r\n\r\n“No need to worry,” Rarity replied. “Now, how long would you say you had this discussion?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, for only about five minutes or so,” Fancy said. “They gave me a demonstration, you see. After that, I said my farewells and returned to the garden with drinks in tow. You were there for my return, you’ll recall.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I was,” Rarity said. “Let’s change topics. What can you tell me about the Major? You seemed acquainted with him in the hall.”\r\n\r\n“Major Mustardgrass? Well, quite a bit, really; he was quite the figure in the Zebraharan conflicts. Led the third company, to great success. Why—”\r\n\r\nRarity cut him off with a wave of her hoof. “I’m afraid we don’t have time for his entire life story. What do you know about him and Blueblood?”\r\n\r\nFancy frowned. “I confess, I don’t know much about Blueblood’s military career. It hardly seemed worth studying; he was only enlisted for three months.”\r\n\r\nRarity pursed her lips. “What about the end of the Major’s career? He said he had been demoted?”\r\n\r\n“I confess, I told a small fib in the hallway,” Fancy said. “I[i] had[/i] heard about his demotion—and his unofficial discharge. I didn’t want to bring it up.”\r\n\r\nRarity leaned forwards over the desk. “Oh?”\r\n\r\n“Apparently, he got greedy towards the end of his time in charge—or so the rumors say, you won’t find this in any book. Supposedly, he was caught smuggling gold out of a mine in Zebraha that his troops had been using as a base of operations.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes. He was stripped of his rank and quietly shuffled out of power, or so they say. His superiors likely tried to keep this quiet out of respect for his legacy. This would have been seven or eight years ago, I would expect.”\r\n\r\n“Fascinating,” Rarity said. “Back to the matter at hoof: tell me, at any point while we were in the dining room, did you see anyone move towards Blueblood’s glass?”\r\n\r\n“No, I most certainly did not.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see any odd telekinesis, then?” Rarity asked.\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“Anything else odd? Anything at all? Perhaps something that might have slipped under your attention?”\r\n\r\n“I really cannot say I did,” he said.\r\n\r\n“In that case,” Rarity said, “This interview is concluded. One last thing: would you mind turning out your pockets?”\r\n\r\n“Not a problem at all,” he said. He stood and did so, turning out each one individually and laying their contents onto the table. The folded-card invitation to the party, two bits, and a length of cord, frazzled on one end.\r\n\r\n“Wonderful. That will be all; you can go now.”\r\n\r\n“Splendid. Does this mean I’m free of suspicion?” Fancy Pants asked, standing. “As it were?”\r\n\r\n“Something like that.”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n“Are you alright, Daring?” Rarity asked. “You look dreadful.”\r\n\r\n“I-I’m alright,” Fleur said. It was her in the chair, this time. She kept her hooves together, and her forelegs rubbed against one another seemingly of their own accord every so often. “Just… a little shaken, that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t blame you,” Rarity said. “Anyone would be, in this situation.”\r\n\r\n“Not you,” Fleur said. “You’re the very picture of composure!”\r\n\r\n“One becomes very good at faking it in my industry,” Rarity said. “Besides which, I have other things to distract me. Now then, tell me everything that happened from the time you arrived to when we met in the garden.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try,” Fleur said, a waver still in her voice.\r\n\r\nFleur then narrated everything from the time she left the carriage to the time Rarity had arrived in great detail, running through exactly who she’d had conversations with in the garden, what they’d talked about, the approximate time Fancy had gone to get drinks and what they’d been drinking at the time, and all without stopping for breath.\r\n\r\nIt was a downpour of details, an avalanche of an account, a crashing cavalcade of a conversation, albeit one-sided. It also told Rarity nothing that Fancy hadn’t already.\r\n\r\n“Does any of that help?” Fleur asked, once she’d finished.\r\n\r\n“I’m… sure at least some of it will,” Rarity said. “Now, once we’d gotten to the dining room, did you see anything unusual, at all? Anyone moving near Blueblood’s glass, anyone doing anything at all odd?”\r\n\r\nFleur thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n“I can’t say that I saw anyone do anything to Blueblood’s glass,” she said. “But there was one thing…”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nFleur bit her lip. “Well, I wouldn’t want to cast doubt where there may not be any, but the ponies who sat closet to Blueblood’s glass were Rainbow Dash and the Major, and I know you’ll vouch for Rainbow Dash…”\r\n\r\n“You think the Major may have done something?”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Just that he was in the place to be if he [i]had…[/i] and that he chose that place himself. He sat down before the rest of us.”\r\n\r\n“Interesting,” Rarity said. “But what about Dela Crème? She was sitting next to him on that side, across from me. It wouldn’t have been that much harder for her to administer the poison, especially if she was keeping him distracted through conversation.”\r\n\r\nFleur’s face had grown progressively paler as Rarity had said this. By the end of this, she was as white as a sheet—impressive, considering how light of a shade she was normally.\r\n\r\n“I assume you can vouch for her character, what with you two being such longstanding friends?”\r\n\r\n“Ah… yes, of course.”\r\n\r\nRarity hummed. “In that case, there is only one more thing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, really?” Fleur said, relief flooding into her voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Could I see your purse, please?”\r\n\r\nFleur blinked, and the colour that had been ebbing back into her face faded again. “Why… you cannot think that [i]I [/i]poisoned him, can you?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” Rarity said, reaching across the table and laying a hoof on Fleur’s shoulder. “But it is a detective’s job to be thorough, and I always was a method actress.”\r\n\r\n“I… I see,” Fleur said. She levitated the purse up and began to empty it of its contents. First a few bits, then her invitation, still in its envelope, then a make-up case—this Rarity inspected closely—and, finally, a handkerchief, with “F.d.L.” embroidered on its corner. She then put the purse itself onto the desk, which Rarity picked up and looked through.\r\n\r\nWhen Rarity was satisfied, she placed the purse back onto the table and allowed Fleur to return her things to it.\r\n\r\n“That will be all,” Rarity said. “Unless you have anything else you’d like to share?”\r\n\r\n“N-not at all,” Fleur said, and hurried towards the door.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n“So,” Rarity said, putting her hooves on the table. “Enough of this charade, hm? Who are you, really?”\r\n\r\n“I have no idea what it is you’re referring to,” Dela said, adjusting her veil.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think you do,” Rarity said. “You see, two years ago, I was hired by the mayor of Vancouver to make a wedding dress for his daughter; he had seen my designs a year prior during a meeting of state in Canterlot. While I was there, I was treated like royalty. I was invited to a great many parties, far nicer ones than this one.”\r\n\r\n“Your point being?”\r\n\r\n“My point,” Rarity said, “being that, although I met almost every pony of any note on the entire western coast of Equestria, [i]your name never came up.[/i] Which is why, earlier, I asked you from where south of Vanhoover you hailed.”\r\n\r\nThe corner of her mouth turned up.\r\n\r\n“And you answered ‘Griffon’s bay’, which any native would know lies to the [i]north[/i] of Vanhoover. So I ask again!” She slammed her hooves on the table. “Who are you, really?”\r\n\r\nDela said nothing.\r\n\r\n“I should warn you, if you don’t tell me, I will make a point of informing everyone else. I’m sure they’d all love to ask you some questions at that point. I can assure you they will be less professional about it than I.”\r\n\r\nDela smiled. “You’re smarter than I gave you credit for,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe pulled off her hat and veil. She looked to be in her late thirties, but scar that crossed half her face made her look even older.\r\n\r\n“My name is Stalwart Guard,” she said. “I work for the Peryton Detective Agency.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a police-for-hire.”\r\n\r\n“Some would say that. Others would say ‘pig’.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I wouldn’t want to insult the pigs,” Rarity said. “I imagine you don’t do much actual detecting, considering I’m the one asking you questions.”\r\n\r\n“Bodyguarding, mostly.”\r\n\r\n“Bodyguarding [i]whom?”[/i]\r\n\r\n“Can’t say.”\r\n\r\n“And why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because of a little thing called ‘client confidentiality’,” she said, her eyes narrowing. “You seem to like playing detective. Figure it out yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Fine then,” Rarity said. “Tell me how you got that scar.”\r\n\r\n“This?” Stalwart said, wincing unconsciously. “The unfortunate result of an accident during basic training, back when I served in the military.”\r\n\r\n“Guard or standing?”\r\n\r\n“Standing. I served for eight years.”\r\n\r\n“The wound. Sword or spear?”\r\n\r\n“Sword. A soldier I was training with’s grip slipped.”\r\n\r\n“And this was while you were serving under Major Mustardgrass, or before?”\r\n\r\n“Before—”\r\n\r\nStalwart’s eyes widened, and she jerked back in her seat.\r\n\r\n“How could you possibly know about that!?” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“A hunch,” Rarity said. “He didn’t ask you for an introduction when he met you at the door to the dining room, supposedly for the first time. This means he already knew you previously—but he knew enough not to say anything about it. Obviously, you had met before.”\r\n\r\nStalwart face betrayed her bewilderment, but she continued. “Well, er—this was before that.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about him.”\r\n\r\n“He was as good an officer as any ever had,” she said. “Sharp, no-nonsense, and proud, very proud, of his country and his work.”\r\n\r\n“So proud of his work that he chose to smuggle gold out of the country he was supposed to be protecting?” Rarity said. “Well, I suppose—”\r\n\r\nStalwart slammed her hooves on the table, the noise and motion of it making Rarity flinch.\r\n\r\n“The Major had nothing to do with that!” she roared. “It was a setup! They framed him!”\r\n\r\nThe door to the library slammed open. It was Rainbow.\r\n\r\n“What’s going on!? I heard shouting—ooh, nice scar.”\r\n\r\n“Calm down, please!” Rarity said. “Both of you! Rainbow, everything is fine; please shut the door.”\r\n\r\nRainbow pulled the door closed slowly, keeping her narrowed eyes on Stalwart. Stalwart, for her part, sat back down in the chair and brushed off her lace.\r\n\r\n“Now then,” Rarity said. “We were just discussing the exploits of the Major in Zebraha, weren’t we? You say that he was framed for the incident that earned him his demotion?”\r\n\r\n“He was!” Stalwart said. “I have no doubts.”\r\n\r\n“And you have evidence to back this up?”\r\n\r\n“The only evidence I need is the five years I spent under him,” she said.\r\n\r\n“So you would testify to his character, then.”\r\n\r\n“Of course! He was an inspiration. The best commanding officer I ever had the pleasure of serving under, and the most loyal to his country. I tell you, there is no possible way he could have done what they said he had.” She punctuated this statement with a nod, as if agreeing with herself.\r\n\r\nRarity frowned. “And who is ‘they’, exactly?”\r\n\r\n“His superiors,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And why would they do that?”\r\n\r\n“To cover up who was [i]really[/i] smuggling gold out of Zebraha.”\r\n\r\nRarity leaned forwards, folding her hooves on the tabletop. Her eyes narrowed to a point.\r\n\r\n“And that was…?”\r\n\r\nStalwart smirked.\r\n\r\n“You’re the detective,” she said. “Figure it out.”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nDela—veil replaced—stepped back through the doorway into the library, and Rarity followed her out. She hadn’t been able to get anything further out of the mare. Her shoes made click-clacking noises on the wooden floor as she crossed it and sat down.\r\n\r\n“Everything’s alright then?” The butler asked. “We were all a bit worried, when we heard the shouting.”\r\n\r\n“Just fine,” Rarity said. “A minor misunderstanding, that’s—”\r\n\r\nShe stopped. Her nostrils flared.\r\n\r\n“Why am I smelling smoke?”\r\n\r\n“It’s probably the fire,” the Major said.\r\n\r\n“Fire? What…”\r\n\r\nIt was then that Rarity’s eyes landed on the fireplace. It had been empty, before, but now a healthy blaze had been lit in its bosom. Its warmth bled out into the room.\r\n\r\nRarity almost screamed. This would have been most unladylike, however, and so she settled for just running over to the hearth and dropping to her knees. She snatched a wrought-iron shovel from a rack to the side of the fireplace and began digging through the embers.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong, Rares?” Rainbow asked from behind her.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong? [i]What’s wrong!?”[/i]\r\n\r\nAnother pile of embers shifted.\r\n\r\n“You lit a fire! That’s what’s wrong!”\r\n\r\nThe Major coughed. “I was a little chilly, so I asked our stallion if he wouldn’t mind putting a fire together. My old bones, you see—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care about your bones, or how old they are! You may have just ruined everything!”\r\n\r\nShe wrenched something from the fire with her magic, sending embers skittering across the floor. She paid them no mind, instead throwing whatever it was she’d retrieved to the ground and stamping on it until it ceased burning.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it was kind of a silly idea, lighting a fire in a library,” Fancy said.\r\n\r\n“That’s not what I mean at all!” Rarity said. She peeled the thing she’d retrieved off of the ground. It looked to be a piece of paper, or rather, the remains of one.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” she said, “that you’ve given the murderer a perfect means of destroying evidence! None of you saw who did this?”\r\n\r\nNone of them had.\r\n\r\nThe paper was laid out onto the table. Everyone stood and gathered around, eager to lay eyes on this latest clue, this newest bit of evidence. Could it be the one to reveal the culprit? Could it be the final piece to the puzzle? Most of it had been rendered unreadable. What hadn’t been…\r\n\r\n“Oh my,” Rarity said, her cheeks suddenly growing pink.\r\n\r\n“That is, er, that is to say,” Fancy said, “ah… yes, what she said. Quite.”\r\n\r\nFleur turned away, a fierce blush taking over her own features. The Major said nothing, but he didn’t need to; the upwards vector of his eyebrows said plenty. Dela seemed to have no interest.\r\n\r\n“I can’t say I’ve ever thought to try something like [i]that,[/i]” Mr. Orange said.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t think you [i]could[/i] do that with a pineapple,” his wife added.\r\n\r\n“I don’t even know why you’d [i]want [/i]to,” Rainbow said.\r\n\r\nRarity snatched the scraps up. She coughed into her hoof, then turned to the butler.\r\n\r\n“Right. Excuse me, did Blueblood have a room in which he did business? A study?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course,” the butler said.\r\n\r\n“Could you show me the way there, please?”\r\n\r\n“If you insist, ma’am, but whatever for?”\r\n\r\n“I have a hunch,” Rarity said. “Rainbow? Would you care to join me?”\r\n\r\n“Uh… what about…?” She jerked her head back at the other guests.\r\n\r\n“Never mind them,” Rarity whispered, “If they were going to do anything, they already have. This is more important.”\r\n\r\nShe turned back to the butler. “Well, shall we?”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nBlueblood’s study was clean. This was the first thing that struck Rarity and Rainbow as the butler gave them entrance. He remained by the door as they moved inside, keeping watch.\r\n\r\nThe room was wood-paneled, and much of it was taken up by two desks. One, massive and mahogany, with endless brass-knobbed drawers and a smooth coat of varnish. The sort of desk that puts the “executive” in “executive official”, the “bureau” in “bureaucrat”.\r\n\r\nThe other was a small writing desk with a stool and noticeably more papers atop it. It was the sort of desk that put the “clerk desk” in “desk clerk”.\r\n\r\nIt was towards this one that Rarity moved. She began to shuffle through the top layer of documents.\r\n\r\n“What are you looking for, Rares?” Rainbow asked.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you if I find it, darling,” Rarity said, then, a moment later: “Ah-ha!”\r\n\r\nShe pulled a sheet out of a stack of similar sheets. A blank piece of stationary, with a decorative border. She held the scraps of the letter up next to it.\r\n\r\n“Just as I suspected,” she said.\r\n\r\nRainbow came up beside her. “What?”\r\n\r\n“Look, there. The border on the stationary. Yes? Now, look at the border on the burnt paper.”\r\n\r\n“They’re the same,” Rainbow remarked.\r\n\r\n“Exactly! Which makes it fairly obvious who the author of this particular, er… [i]diatribe,[/i] was.”\r\n\r\n“But hang on,” she said. “The hornwriting isn’t the same.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but that hardly matters,” Rarity said. “I’d expect he had two different servants write these. What [i]is[/i] important is that the stationary is the same.”\r\n\r\n“Seriously? He has servants just to write letters?”\r\n\r\n“He’s the richest stallion on the continent,” Rarity said. “I’d be shocked if he’d had to write anything longer than his signature in decades.”\r\n\r\nRainbow considered this. “Y’know, the fact that that letter was dictated only makes it more gross.”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree,” Rarity said, returning to the pile. She shuffled through a few more layers, and then withdrew another paper.\r\n\r\n“Look at this,” she said. “It’s an invoice. From the oranges, by the looks of it.”\r\n\r\nShe scanned it. Her eyebrows shot up.\r\n\r\n“A hundred bottles?” she gasped. “The Oranges weren’t lying; he really did enjoy his orange wines! Just look at the price tag!”\r\n\r\nThe butler lit his horn and snatched the paper out of her magic. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but I must ask that you keep your snooping to the matter at hand; we’ll have the lawyers in to deal with all of this.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I can assure you, this is [i]very[/i] relevant,” Rarity said, snatching it back. She held the invoice out to Rainbow. “Here, smell this.”\r\n\r\nRainbow took it without question. “Mmm… oranges?” she said. “But, like, fake oranges?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” Rarity said. “Like what ponies think an orange is supposed to smell like, not what it actually smells like.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, just like that!” Rainbow said.\r\n\r\n“Good; I was worried I was imagining things.”\r\n\r\n“Really, ma’am,” the butler said, “I must insist you leave His Late Highness’s affairs be!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think he much minds, being dead and all,” Rarity said, but nonetheless she returned the invoice to its place on the desk. “Regardless, I have what I needed. Now, shall we return to the—”\r\n\r\nShe paused. The picture behind the bigger desk, which had previously been ignored for being yet another[i][/i]painting of Blueblood, had now caught her eye. Mainly because it wasn’t just a picture of Blueblood.\r\n\r\nOh, he was in it, certainly; he stood front and center, his self-absorbed smile illuminated by the same spotlight sunbeam that set him apart from the rest of the scene. He wore military dress, although his seemed to fit him far worse than the Major’s.\r\n\r\nAnd standing next to him was a rendition—somewhat more sloppily done—of the Major himself.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s interesting…”\r\n\r\nRarity crossed the room and stood in front of the portrait, inspecting every inch of it. There was a brass plate affixed to the bottom of the frame:\r\n\r\n[center][smcaps]Zebraha, 1032[/smcaps][/center]\r\n\r\n“Eight years ago,” she muttered. “Hm…”\r\n\r\n“Is that the Major?” Rainbow asked.\r\n\r\n“It would appear so,” Rarity said. She spun about to face them. “Oh well. Let us rejoin the others.”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n“Splendid, splendid.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not listening,” Mrs. Orange hissed. “I never—”\r\n\r\nThe door to the library swung open, and both she and Fancy Pants turned sharply towards it.\r\n\r\n“Are we interrupting something?” Rarity asked, striding in, followed closely by Rainbow and the butler. “Please, continue.”\r\n\r\n“I was just telling Mr. Pants that a shipment I’d sent out using his company that hadn’t yet reached its destination,” Mrs. Orange said. “He claims no knowledge of it, of course. You know how it is with these shipping companies.”\r\n\r\n“And I can assure you,” Fancy said, “that Fancy Freight is no mere ‘shipping company’, and that our employees are known for their competency and for their speed. Your package will reach its destination soon enough. You have my word.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well in that case I won’t disturb you,” Rarity said. She cast her eyes over the other inhabitants of the room.\r\n\r\nThe Major and Dela were chatting again, though both were doing so in lowered voices. Fleur sat off to one side in a lounge chair, staring into theؙ—now unlit and smoldering—fireplace.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Orange had a book in his hooves. Rarity approached him.\r\n\r\n“Doing a little light reading?” she asked. He started at her intrusion, pulling the book closed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, just a little,” he said. “I do enjoy the classics.”\r\n\r\nRarity glanced at the cover. “[i]Romeoat and Juniper,”[/i] she remarked.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” he said. “One of my favourite tales of all time.”\r\n\r\nRarity smiled. “Well, I must admit, I wouldn’t have pinned you for a fan of the Bard.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Spear Shaker?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t follow.”\r\n\r\n“Would you mind accompanying me into the archive room?” Rarity asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you’re asking, I rather do, yes—”\r\n\r\n“Come along,” Rarity said. “Rainbow? Care to join us? I’d appreciate the company…”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Orange—”\r\n\r\n“Please, call me Mosely.”\r\n\r\n“—could you recount for me everything that happened since you arrived here tonight?”\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Orange’s turn in the chair, now, and he had made himself comfortable. Rainbow stood by the door to the room, leaning against the wall.\r\n\r\nHe tapped his hoof to his chin. “Well, there was an awful lot to get through…”\r\n\r\n“Just do your best, please.”\r\n\r\n“Well… we arrived late. Our carriage lost a wheel partway up the road, you see, and we had to walk the rest of the way. Oh, it was awful! But we arrived around six-forty.”\r\n\r\n“And it was just you and your wife, correct?” Rarity asked. “Neither of you brought a guest?”\r\n\r\nMr. Orange nodded. “We had asked around, but no one seemed very enthusiastic about coming, for some unfathomable reason. It’s only the social event of the year, hosted by Equestria’s esteemed prince. Why would anyone say no?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t imagine.”\r\n\r\n“Neither can I,” he said, “but regardless, we were forced to come on our own.”\r\n\r\n“A pity,” Rarity said. “And what did the two of you do after you arrived?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we mingled, of course,” he said, frowning. “What else does one do at a party?”\r\n\r\n“Not enjoy yourself, clearly,” Rainbow mumbled.\r\n\r\n“And then…?”\r\n\r\n“Then Blueblood’s butler came and collected me. He was awfully polite about the whole thing, a very good butler. I’ve always wanted a butler, you know. Valencia has always been against the idea, of course. I wonder, now that His Highness is no longer with us…”\r\n\r\nRarity found her attention drawn by a stain on the wall behind Mr. Orange. Deciding whether it was the result of a clumsy servant or something more sinister was proving more entertaining than listening to him. “And he brought you to the dining room door?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “And he told me to wait there.”\r\n\r\nRarity nodded, and opened her mouth to ask her next question—but then frowned.\r\n\r\n“You say the butler came and collected [i]you,[/i]” she said. “What about your wife?”\r\n\r\nMr. Orange blinked. “Ah, well, she was already there, waiting. And she wasn’t very happy about it, either! Of course, she almost never is—”\r\n\r\n“So, hang on,” Rainbow said. “Mrs. Orange wasn’t with you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no; she’d gone to use the little filly’s room. Did I not mention that?”\r\n\r\n“You most certainly did not!” Rarity said.\r\n\r\n“Well, it was hardly important.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, it might be the only important thing you’ve ever said!” Rarity leaned forwards, her eyes now focused. “Around when did she excuse herself?”\r\n\r\n“Well, um, I’m not sure I could say,” Mr. Orange said, his demeanor suddenly breaking under the full force of Rarity’s attention. “Around seven, maybe?”\r\n\r\n“And how long before you saw her again?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, er… five minutes or so? Ten? I can’t quite recall—”\r\n\r\n“And do you actually know where she went?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no, I don’t make a habit of following my wife to the bathroom—”\r\n\r\n“So you did not actually see her go into the restrooms?”\r\n\r\n“No! No, I did not. You don’t think—\r\n\r\n“What I think will be revealed in due time, Mr. Orange,” Rarity said. “But for now, this interview is concluded.”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n“So,” Rarity said. “Valencia—”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Orange, please.”\r\n\r\n“—could you tell me what exactly happened after you arrived here tonight?”\r\n\r\nIn contrast to her husband, Mrs. Orange sat ruler-straight in the chair. You could have verified a level off of her posture. A protractor, too.\r\n\r\n“Nothing much,” she said. “Mosely and I arrived, we mingled, we were taken aside by the butler, brought to the dining room, and told to wait. And then we waited. For half an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Together?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, ‘together’?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” Rarity said, “you seem to be insinuating that you and your husband were together the entire time. Is that true?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no. I took a trip to the restrooms, and it was on my way back from there that the butler found me. Mosely caught up with me after that. It hardly matters.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see,” Rarity said. “May I have a look inside your bag?”\r\n\r\n“If you have to. I’ve got nothing to hide.”\r\n\r\nThe bag was passed over, and Rarity began to sift through it. A makeup case. A coin purse. Some pens.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about your dealings with Blueblood,” Rarity said. A notepad. A lens. A packet of breath mints—Rarity regarded these with extra scrutiny.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s as I said earlier,” Mrs. Orange said. “He was our biggest buyer of orange wine. And he paid quite well for it, too.”\r\n\r\nA pair of sewing scissors. An invitation.\r\n\r\n“And that was all he ever bought from you?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all he ever specifically bought from us, yes,” she said. “Of course, our fruits are shipped and sold throughout Equestria, so it wouldn’t be too far to think he’s bought something from one of our vendors. I don’t see how this is relevant.”\r\n\r\nSatisfied, Rarity snapped the bag shut and placed it back on the table. “Well, one can never be too thorough. What did you think of Blueblood, personally?”\r\n\r\n“He was an oaf, a buffoon, and a loyal customer. Do you actually have any relevant questions, or is this interview just as much of a farce as your credentials?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a relevant question for ‘ya,” Rainbow said. “How’d you get that stick so far up your—”\r\n\r\nRarity clicked her tongue. “Now, Rainbow, no need to be crass.” She turned her attention back to Mrs. Orange. “One last question, and then you may go: did you cross paths with any of the other ponies in the library before you were brought to the dining room?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” Rarity asked. “I would think that, as you and your husband and everyone else at this party so enjoy mingling, that you would have spoken to at least Fleur and Fancy.”\r\n\r\n“I never got the chance to,” she said. “We arrived late. Now, if we’re done?”\r\n\r\nRarity smiled. “We are.”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n“So,” Rarity said. “Tell me how you knew Blueblood.”\r\n\r\n“Bit of an odd question, isn’t it?” the Major said. He had reclined into the seat with the grace of the elderly, and the twine-wrapped package he’d been carrying around all evening reclined next to him.\r\n\r\n“I hardly think so,” Rarity said. She smiled. “You met during your time in the military, I presume?”\r\n\r\n“You presume right,” he said. “I had been serving for a decade and a half; he had been serving for two weeks.”\r\n\r\n“And he was under your command?”\r\n\r\nThe Major snorted. “He was my commanding officer.”\r\n\r\n“What?” Rainbow said. “How? That’s like… that’d be like if Spitfire was suddenly reporting to Songbird Serenade!”\r\n\r\n“Money changed hooves,” the Major said. “The standing military isn’t nearly as inscrutable as the guard. Maybe that’s why we’re the only ones who ever get anything done.” His brow crinkled, adding an extra layer of lines. “Spitfire… You’re a fan of the Wonderbolts, Mrs. Dash?”\r\n\r\nRainbow puffed up her chest. “Not just a fan anymore! I’m a full-fledged member!”\r\n\r\n“Oh? I’m sorry, I haven’t kept up on the rosters. You’re enlisted, then?”\r\n\r\n“I’m a lieutenant, technically.”\r\n\r\n“Well, good on you,” the Major said. “Remember to treat your CO with respect. No matter how hard they’re working you, they’re working double.”\r\n\r\n“Unless their name is Blueblood?” Rarity said.\r\n\r\nThe Major snorted again. “Unless their name is Blueblood,” he repeated. “Stuck-up fool never lifted a hoof.”\r\n\r\n“Care to elaborate?”\r\n\r\n“He loved the power of the position,” the Major said. “He loved ordering us around—especially me and my soldiers, and he probably broke the chain of command more times than he broke a sweat. And we were stationed right in the middle of Zebraha, the hottest sinkhole south of Tartarus!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped to laugh, a dry, wheezy thing, then continued.\r\n\r\n“What he didn’t like was the responsibility,” he said. “All he wanted was to play tin soldiers. So I ended up doing his work, and mine, on top of that catering to whatever his whim of the day was. It was enough to drive a stallion to murder—not that I’d ever contemplate such a thing, of course. Besides, he left the army not long afterwards. Got bored of us, I suspect.”\r\n\r\n“And was this before or after your demotion?” Rarity asked.\r\n\r\nThe Major’s face fell.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, his voice low, “there’s no need to go digging up the past.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure you understand exactly what it is a detective does, Major.”\r\n\r\nThe Major narrowed his eyes. “Well, good thing you aren’t a real detective then, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Fine then. What is that in that case you have, there?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this?” He patted the side of the package. “A present for the prince. I figured I owed him something, it being his birthday. Though I see no one else got him anything.”\r\n\r\n“How generous of you,” Rarity said. “May I take a look at it?”\r\n\r\n“Sure.” He dropped it onto the table; it landed with a muffled metallic clang. “Heck, you can keep it. I don’t want them, and he won’t be needing them.”\r\n\r\n“Noted,” Rarity said. “Could you tell me everything that happened since you arrived?”\r\n\r\nAnd so it went, with Rarity asking her usual questions, and so it went with the usual answers. He’d arrived early, and he’d mingled (“What is it with you ponies and mingling?” Rainbow had asked) until he’d gotten tired, and then he’d gone inside and found a spot to sit, whereupon the butler had found him. No, he hadn’t seen anyone go near Blueblood’s drink.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” Rarity said. “That will be all.”\r\n\r\nThe Major got up slowly and, nodding on his way out to Rainbow, left the room, letting the door close behind him.\r\n\r\n“He seems pretty cool,” Rainbow said.\r\n\r\nRarity circled around the table, pushing the chair out of the way and moving the case into the center of the table. “You would say that, darling.”\r\n\r\n“He’s the murderer, isn’t he?”\r\n\r\nRarity took the twine that surrounded the package in her magic and pulled. It didn’t budge. “Whatever makes you say that?”\r\n\r\n“Because last time I thought someone was cool, you found out they were evil,” Rainbow said. She had crossed the room now, and was watching Rarity’s struggles.\r\n\r\n“I’d hardly have called Wind Rider—” Rarity grit her teeth. The package in her grasp continued to thwart her efforts. “Ugh. I’d hardly have called Wind Rider ‘evil,” darling, and a sample size of one isn’t a trend.”\r\n\r\n“You get that from Twilight?”\r\n\r\n“On one of our drinking nights, yes,” Rarity said. She dropped the package back onto the table.\r\n\r\n“Need some help with that?”\r\n\r\n“No need, darling,” she said. “Ah… would you mind turning away for a moment?”\r\n\r\n“…Why?”\r\n\r\n“My dignity.”\r\n\r\n“Um… alright.”\r\n\r\nRainbow turned to face the door. She stayed that way for a few moments. Upon Rarity’s announcement of “Done!” she turned back around, only to find that the packaging around the case had been removed, and the twine that had held it had been split cleanly.\r\n\r\n“How did you—” she began to ask, but then Rarity opened the case. “Whoa…”\r\n\r\nInside were a pair of swords, sabers. They both gleamed in the light like it had just been finished that day.\r\n\r\nRarity lifted them out of the box with care. “Hm… exquisite craftsmanship. But why two swords?”\r\n\r\n“They’re for dueling,” Rainbow said.She took to the air and snatched one of them from Rarity’s magic with her teeth. She swung it a few times, using her neck and wings to guide it. The maneuver was less “graceful” and more “dog with stick”, but it worked. She managed to keep a good two inches away from breaking anything, too.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rarity examined her sword’s edge. “Yes, I do believe you’re right,” she said. “Somewhat morbid for a gift, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\nRainbow spat the sword out into her cradled hooves. “Only if ‘morbid’ is another word for ‘awesome’!”\r\n\r\n“It is not.”\r\n\r\n“Then you need to get your dictionary checked,” Rainbow said. “Is the other one a pegasus sword, too?”\r\n\r\n“A what?”\r\n\r\n“A pegasus sword. Y’know, lightweight? Easier to fly with? Weird to see one this bulky in the handle, though.”\r\n\r\nRarity lifted the other sword up with her magic, testing its weight. “I should say not,” she said. “It’s quite heavy, really. Since when do you know so much about swordplay?”\r\n\r\nRainbow shrugged. “Swords are awesome. I’m awesome. Transitive property.”\r\n\r\n“I believe that would make you a sword, darling, if my math is correct.”\r\n\r\n“Your math just isn’t on my level of cool yet.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” Rarity mused, “why would the major give Blueblood one normal sword and one pegasus sword? Especially as a matching set?”\r\n\r\nRainbow shrugged. “I’m not complaining. Hey, he said that we could keep these, right? Because I sculpted a fireplace for my cloud house this year, and I’ve been needing something to go on the wall over it…”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course, darling,” Rarity said, but it was clear by the way her voice trailed off that her thoughts were focused elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments, she straightened up. “Well, that settles that.”\r\n\r\n“What settles what?”\r\n\r\n“The penultimate piece of the puzzle,” Rarity said, striding towards the door. There was an extra sashay in her step, one that had been noticeably absent the rest of the night.\r\n\r\n“The pen-what?”\r\n\r\n“The next-to-last piece.” Rarity set her magic on the doorknob, then turned back to look at Rainbow. She was smiling. A devilish, I-know-your-secret-and-I’m-going-to-tell-[i]everyone[/i] sort of smile.\r\n\r\n“You’ll see, darling,” she said. “You’ll see. I just have one more thing I need to check first.”\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n“Through these doors are the kitchens,” the butler said. “As you requested.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. I’ll just be a few minutes, and then I think we can wrap all of this up. Are you not coming?”\r\n\r\n“I will remain here,” the butler said. “The kitchen staff and I… do not see eye to eye on some things.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, could you gather the others in the east dining room, at the scene of the crime?” Rarity asked. “Tell them I will have an announcement to make when I return. I believe Rainbow and I can find our way back on our own.”\r\n\r\nRarity stepped through the swinging double doors and into the kitchens, Rainbow following close behind her. They’d come here straight from the library, but their route had necessarily taken them past the foyer, where they’d seen several of the other guests.\r\n\r\nIt had been evident from their faces and the nervous quality of their conversation that knowledge of the night’s occurrences had spread to the rest of the partygoers, though what form that took was anyone’s guess.\r\n\r\nThe kitchens themselves were, as one should have expected by this point, grand and well-furnished. Ovens lay below clean slate counters, shiny steel implements hung on carefully-organized racks, but these trivialities were hardly eye-catching at this point.\r\n\r\nNo, what really drew attention was the [i]cooks.[/i] There was a whole team of them, and they ducked and wove around one another like dancers, darting over to one workstation, then to the next, in a display that could only be the product of either careful choreography or a dozen years of circus performances between them.\r\n\r\nIt was a shame that Rarity had interrupt it, but such was the price of justice.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” she said. “Could I speak to the head chef for a few minutes? It’s of the utmost importance.”\r\n\r\nOne of the chefs broke off from the rest. “That would be me, ma’am. What can I help you with?” He was a strikingly tall stallion, with an equally striking mustache that twitched when he spoke.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to ask you a few questions,” Rarity said. “If you wouldn’t mind.”\r\n\r\n“I assume this is about the unfortunate incident which has befallen our employer?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It it indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Then you must be that lady detective they’ve been talking about.”\r\n\r\n“Only when it suits me,” Rarity said. “Are they really talking about me?”\r\n\r\n“I think half the household has been! It’s not every day something like this happens, is it? Everyone else has gotten all excited. Me, though, I want nothing to do with it, no ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“It may already be too late for that,” Rarity said. “Tell me, did a stallion come in here earlier? Shorter than you, wearing a suit and monocle? Says ‘I say’ a lot?”\r\n\r\n“That’d be Mr. Pant’s you’re talking about?”\r\n\r\n“He prefers Fancy,” Rarity said. “I understand you all gave him a demonstration of how to properly prepare pufferfish?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, we did!” one of the other chefs called out. “He was keen on the subject, he was!”\r\n\r\n“Good thing we had those extra fish in the larder!” another one said. “We had to show him three times before he was satisfied!”\r\n\r\n“And how long would you say that took?” Rarity asked.\r\n\r\nThe head chef thought for a moment. “Oh, a good five minutes if I had to guess. Why? Is it important?”\r\n\r\n“It very well might be.” She gestured across the kitchen, to a door opposite the one they’d come in on. “That door, where does it lead?”\r\n\r\n“To the west hallway,” the head chef said. “We’re at about the middle of the house, and there’s a dining room in both wings, so we have a door for each.”\r\n\r\n“How convenient. Tell me, did Blueblood have any peculiar habits when it came to his champagne?”\r\n\r\nThe head chef snorted. “I’ll say. Now, are we talking normal pony peculiar, or high-society peculiar? Because there were plenty of both.”\r\n\r\n“Either will do.”\r\n\r\n“Well—”\r\n\r\n“He had us open a new bottle every night!” another chef called out, partway through rolling a new sheet of pasta. “And then throw out whatever was left of it when he went to bed! He had the money for it, he’d say!”\r\n\r\nRarity cast a side glance at Rainbow. “More of your tax dollars at work, there, darling.”\r\n\r\n“Figures,” Rainbow said, though she sounded distracted.\r\n\r\n“We never did throw them out, though!” one of the other chefs said. “We’d say we would, then share it out around the staff! He was such a lightweight, we’d always have enough for a second round!”\r\n\r\n“You might want to skip that tonight,” Rarity said. “The poison and all.”\r\n\r\n“No worries! We’ve got an entire cellar to raid, now! We’ll all be going home with a bottle or five of poison tonight!”\r\n\r\nThere was a hearty cheer from the kitchen staff at that.\r\n\r\nThe head chef coughed. “Perhaps it would be better not to announce our plans [i]in front of a detective,”[/i] he hissed.\r\n\r\n“No need to worry,” Rarity said. “I’m only a detective when it suits me. Now, was there anything else?”\r\n\r\n“There was one thing,” the head chef said. “Whenever guests were over, he’d always have us open two bottles: one for his guests, and a more expensive one for him.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” Rarity said. “And did he have you do that tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Yep! His choice from the cellar. He gave us strict instructions only to pour it for his glass.”\r\n\r\n“Our courteous host,” Rarity muttered. “Could I see this bottle?”\r\n\r\n“Sure; it’s over there, in the ice bucket on the counter. I don’t think anyone’s touched it since.”\r\n\r\nRarity strode over to the counter. There was the bottle, indeed, sitting in its own ice bucket alongside another that was far more filled. She lifted it out.\r\n\r\nRarity didn’t know all that much about wines; she’d always been more of a cocktail mare, though she’d never admit it in polite company. But just by looking at the label, she could tell this was what some might have called “the good stuff.”\r\n\r\nThe top was uncorked; she brought it up to her nostrils and took a whiff.\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n“Rainbow,” she said, turning around, “I do believe I’ve—”\r\n\r\nRainbow Dash wasn’t behind her, as she’d assumed. No, the pegasus was occupying herself at one of the counters—preparing to occupy herself with a steaming plate of stuffed snail shells.\r\n\r\n“Oh, for Celestia’s sake…”\r\n\r\nRarity, of course, was a high-society mare. A [i]lady.[/i] And so, when she marched across the kitchen floor, she did so [i]daintily. [/i]When she grabbed Rainbow’s tail in her magic, she did so [i]with grace. [/i]And when she began to drag the pegasus away from great gastropod gastrointestinal grief, well, you can imagine.\r\n\r\n“Oh, c’mon!” Rainbow moaned as she was pulled across the floor. “I’m a pegasus! My bird half demands snails! Don’t make me deny my instincts!”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“Lemme just have a couple!”\r\n\r\n“Not even one!”\r\n\r\n“But we haven’t eaten anything all night!”\r\n\r\n[i]“Not! Even! One!”[/i]

“Hey, Applejack,” Apple Bloom said, stepping into the kitchen of the Apple family farmhouse. “Have you seen my photo album anywhere?”\r\n\r\nApplejack, up on her hind legs and working at one of the counters, glanced over her shoulder, first at the clock, then at Apple Bloom.\r\n\r\n“Why?” she asked. “Ain’t it in your room?”\r\n\r\n“Nope. Can’t find it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s a shame,” Applejack said, turning back to what she was doing. She took an apple up from the pile beside her and began slicing it with a bladed contraption strapped to her hoof. “No, I don’t think I’ve seen it anywhere. Why are you lookin’ for it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I was going to take it with me,” Apple Bloom said. Applejack’s knife hoof stopped.\r\n\r\n“You’re packin’ already?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Apple Bloom said. “Figured I’d get it done today so I don’t have to rush it tomorrow mornin’. Got my suitcase ready and everything.”\r\n\r\nThe cutting resumed. “Good thinkin’. Less likely to forget anything that way.”\r\n\r\n“Yep,” Apple Bloom said. “’Cept I can’t find my album anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“You sure it ain’t in your room someplace?” Applejack said. “Maybe you had it out and forgot to put it back.”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom frowned. “No, I’m pretty sure I left it on my bookshelf, like I always do. And I turned the whole room upside-down.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m sure you’ll find it eventually.” \r\n\r\nApplejack picked up the cutting board and scraped the apple slices into a bowl to her left, then repeated the procedure on the next fruit. \r\n\r\n“Hey, I know this ain’t the right time for this,” she said, “but are you sure you still don’t want me to go with you tomorrow? Cities can be mighty confusin’ places if you ain’t used to ‘em…”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom rolled her eyes. “Sis, I ain’t a lil’ filly no more. I’ll be fine.”\r\n\r\nIt was true. Time had done well by little Apple Bloom, granting her sturdy legs, a fine coat, and a southern drawl that could seduce a stone. She’d even grown her hair out.\r\n\r\nShe still wore the same bow in her hair as she always had, though. She’d never outgrow that.\r\n\r\n“Sure you are,” Applejack said. “But that don’t mean I have to stop being your big sister, either.”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom rolled her eyes again. “‘Sides, Babs said she’d meet me at the station, so it’s not like I’m gonna get lost or anything. And our house isn’t that far from there, either.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s good to hear,” Applejack said. “Still…”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know. I’ll be careful.”\r\n\r\nWhile Applejack continued working, Apple Bloom crossed the kitchen and sat down at the table in the center. She rested her chin on her hoof.\r\n\r\n“Maybe Big Mac knows where it is,” she mused. “He back from the market yet?”\r\n\r\n“Nope. Sorry.”\r\n\r\n“Fiddlesticks.”\r\n\r\nApplejack began cutting into a new apple. “I’m sure it’ll turn up,” she said. “I’ll help you look once I’m done with this.”\r\n\r\n“Nah, it’s fine,” Apple Bloom said. “What are you makin’, anyways?”\r\n\r\n“Apple pie.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the occasion?”\r\n\r\n“Well, my lil’ sis is moving to Fillydelphia tomorrow, an’ I want to give her one last taste of home before she goes.”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom winced.\r\n\r\n“Also, we’ve got a bunch of apples that’ll be goin’ bad soon, so I wanna use them up before we have to feed them to the pigs,” Applejack continued. She sent another set of apple slices tumbling into the bowl. “And since when do I need a special occasion to make an apple pie?”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom didn’t have a response for that, and for a little while the only sounds in the kitchen were those of fruit dissection.\r\n\r\n“Hey, uh…”\r\n\r\n“Yeah?” Applejack asked.\r\n\r\nApple Bloom swallowed.\r\n\r\n“You and Big Mac’ll be fine without me, right?” she asked. “I know the two of you can handle the farm on your own, but…”\r\n\r\nApplejack chuckled. \r\n\r\n“We ain’t [i]that[/i] old,” she said. “’Least, not yet. We’ll be fine.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, but what about cider season?” Apple Bloom asked. “We barely managed to keep up last year.”\r\n\r\nApplejack hummed. “Well, we might have to hire some farmhands, but we’ll manage. I don’t think either of us would mind if you came back to help, though. Of course, if you’re thinking about changin’ your mind…”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom let out a sigh. “No, just making sure you’re okay with it.”\r\n\r\n“’Course we are,” Applejack said. “We’re happy for you.”\r\n\r\nApplejack laid the knife down on her cutting board and turned around. She was smiling.\r\n\r\n“We’re gonna miss you,” she said. “No doubt about that. But if moving to Fillydelphia is going to make you happy, then I’m behind you, no matter what. And I know Big Mac feels the same way. You could be movin’ to Tartarus and it wouldn’t make no difference to us.”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom smiled back.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, Applejack.”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t no thing.”\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the clock again.\r\n\r\n“Actually, now that I think about it,” she said, “I think I might have seen that album of yours after all.”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom’s ears perked up. “Oh yeah? Where?”\r\n\r\n“Out in the barn,” Applejack said, like it was the most natural thing in the world.\r\n\r\n“Why would it be in the barn?” Apple Bloom asked, frowning.\r\n\r\nApplejack shrugged. “Don’t ask me. I didn’t put it there.”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom’s look remained skeptical. “You sure?”\r\n\r\n“Yep. In the back, sittin’ on one of the hay bales. You probably just took it out there and forgot about it, like I said before.”\r\n\r\n“Well, uh, alright then. Thanks.” \r\n\r\nApple Bloom hopped off her chair. She headed out of the kitchen and took a right down the front hall.\r\n\r\nOpening the front door was like opening an oven. It was a hot day, even for summer; the kind of dry heat that warms you right down to the bone. It had been that way for the past couple of weeks, and there were no signs that it was going to change any time soon.\r\n\r\nApple Bloom didn’t mind, though. She’d always liked Ponyville’s summers, even if days like this one turned routine farmwork into torture. She shielded her eyes from the sun, halfway through its western descent, and headed across the courtyard in the direction of the barn.\r\n\r\nThe barn’s door was shut tight. Apple Bloom frowned. That was odd; they usually left it open during the day.\r\n\r\nShe pushed it open.\r\n\r\n“SURPRISE!”\r\n\r\nA burst of confetti flew into her face.\r\n\r\nThe barn had been done up in ribbons and streamers. Balloons floated lazily overhead. A blue banner had been strung across the rafters, the words “Farewell, Apple Bloom!” written across it in gold letters, and standing under it was what looked like half the town.\r\n\r\nApple Bloom blinked. “You shouldn’t have,” she said. And she meant it, because it was true, but they’d gone ahead and done it anyway.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Ponyville way.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“So then,” Berry Pinch said, “Apple Bloom comes around the corner, right? And she says—she says—”\r\n\r\n“What’d she say?” came the chorus.\r\n\r\n“She says, ‘Pinchy, I ain’t one to judge, but if this is your idea of a fun Saturday night, then I’m goin’ home!’”\r\n\r\nLaughter all around.\r\n\r\nApple Bloom stood up. “I’m gonna go get us some more cider.”\r\n\r\n“Hey, it’s your party!” someone said. “Let someone else go!”\r\n\r\n“Nah, I need a breather anyways. Y’all keep goin’.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you say so!” Pinchy said. “Anyways, there was this one time…”\r\n\r\nThe night air greeted her as she stepped out of the barn. The light and music grew muffled as the doors fell shut behind her.\r\n\r\nThen they grew unmuffled for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t take any more of Pinchy’s stories?” a voice said. Apple Bloom didn’t have to turn around to know who it belonged to.\r\n\r\n“Nope. Just ate too much pie,” she said. “I’m guessin’ this whole thing was your idea, Sweetie Belle?”\r\n\r\n“Guilty as charged!”\r\n\r\nNow, if time had done well by Apple Bloom, then it had been downright bounteous towards Sweetie Belle, blessing her with the body of a dancer and the voice of an angel. Her curls bounced as she laughed. It was almost unfair.\r\n\r\n“Well, you shouldn’t have,” Apple Bloom said. “But I appreciate it anyway.”\r\n\r\nSweetie walked up beside her.\r\n\r\n“So, you uh… gonna come to the train station tomorrow?” Apple Bloom asked. “See me off?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Sweetie Belle replied. “What kind of friend would I be if I didn’t?”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom smiled. “Thanks.”\r\n\r\n“When are you leaving?”\r\n\r\n“Train’s leaving at noon.”\r\n\r\n“That early?” Sweetie Belle said. “Maybe holding the party at night wasn’t such a good idea, after all.”\r\n\r\nApple Bloom raised an eyebrow. “Since when is noon early?”\r\n\r\n“Not all of us get up at the crack of dawn,” Sweetie Belle said. “[i]Some of us[/i] need our beauty sleep.”\r\n\r\n“You’re soundin’ more like your sister every day.”\r\n\r\nSweetie Belle’s cheeks turned red. “I am not!”\r\n\r\n“Sure you ain’t,” Apple Bloom said, chuckling. “Prissy pony.”\r\n\r\nSweetie Belle pouted. Still chuckling, Apple Bloom turned her attention to the little trapdoor set into the ground beside the barn. Kneeling down, she grasped the iron handle in her teeth and pulled it open, revealing a rickety staircase leading down into the darkness.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” she said. “Pass me that lantern, will you?”\r\n\r\nShe was referring to the oil lantern that hung next to the barn’s door, casting a flickering light over the scene. Sweetie Belle’s horn lit, and the thing floated off its hook and over to Apple Bloom. Taking it into her mouth, she descended the rickety staircase.\r\n\r\n“You know,” Sweetie Belle called down after her, “I think the thing I’m going to miss the most after you’re gone is having a direct line to the cider supply.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yeah?” Apple Bloom called back. “That’s all I’m good for, huh?”\r\n\r\n“Yep! That and free pie.”\r\n\r\n“Well then it’s a good thing I’m goin’,” Apple Bloom said. “Wouldn’t want you losing that perfect figure of yours.”\r\n\r\nThe cellar was filled with all kinds of jars and tins, but what she wanted was in the unmarked glass bottles on the back shelf. Placing the lantern down on a shelf to her right, she grabbed a bottle and tucked it under one leg, thought for a moment, then grabbed a second. Hobbling on three legs, she made her way back to the steps.\r\n\r\n“Lil’ help?”\r\n\r\nA green aura surrounded the bottles, lifting them up through the trapdoor. Apple Bloom turned around and snatched up the lantern again, then climbed out of the cellar.\r\n\r\nSweetie Belle was standing at the top of the steps, a bottle of cider levitating on either side of her. Gone was the mirth she’d held in her eyes just a moment ago.\r\n\r\nApple Bloom placed the lantern back on its hook. Its flickering light cast shadows on the side of the barn.\r\n\r\n“You alright?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I still don’t want you to go,” Sweetie said, her voice quiet.\r\n\r\nA lump formed in Apple Bloom’s throat.\r\n\r\n“It won’t be so bad,” she said. “Fillydelphia’s only an hour away by train. You can come visit any time you like.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not the same and you know it.”\r\n\r\n“…Yeah.” She sighed. “I know.”\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds, neither of them spoke; the silence was filled only by the chirping of insects.\r\n\r\n“Just don’t forget about me, okay?” Sweetie finally said.\r\n\r\n“Forget about you?” Apple Bloom grinned. “Couldn’t if I tried.”\r\n\r\nSweetie giggled. Apple Bloom stepped closer and drew her into a hug.\r\n\r\nOver Sweetie’s shoulder, something caught her eye. She glanced up at the farmhouse. One of the windows was lit up, on the second floor. Third from the left… wasn’t that Granny Smith’s room? That couldn’t be right; there was no way she was up at this hour.\r\n\r\nThen, as if it had noticed her looking, the light extinguished itself.\r\n\r\nAfter a few more moments, Sweetie drew out of the hug.\r\n\r\n“Alright,” she said, putting on a smile. “Enough being sappy. This is supposed to be a party!”\r\n\r\n“Darn tootin’,” Apple Bloom said. “Now let’s get back inside before Pinchy wrecks the place.”\r\n\r\nSweetie smirked. “Now who’s starting to sound like their sister?”\r\n\r\n“Shuddup.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApple Bloom sat on the edge of her bed, flipping through the pages of her photo album. The party had ended, the guests gone home, and the barn returned to normal.\r\n\r\nShe chuckled at a picture of her younger self attempting (failing) to juggle, then turned the page. They actually had hidden the book in the barn, if only so Applejack wouldn’t have to lie about seeing it there. She was just glad no one had gotten food on it.\r\n\r\nShe’d started keeping the thing back when she was thirteen. It had started as a Crusader effort to get a cutie mark in something—amateur photography, or something along those lines—but even after they’d all given up on the idea, Apple Bloom had never stopped adding to it.\r\n\r\nShe turned the page again. \r\n\r\nThere was only one picture on this page, stuck right in the center. It had been taken on the day that the three of them had gotten their cutie marks. She was in the middle of the photo, grinning ear to ear, turned sideways so the mark on her flank would be visible. To her right was Sweetie Belle, doing much the same.\r\n\r\nAnd to her left…\r\n\r\nHer smile dimmed slightly.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and closed the book. Hopping off the bed, she brought the thing over to her suitcase, lying open against the far wall. She laid the album into it, nestling it between two towels so it wouldn’t go anywhere, and pulled the lid of the suitcase shut. It locked in place with a click.\r\n\r\nYawning, Apple Bloom crossed the room to snuff out the candle on her nightstand, then climbed into bed. She didn’t bother with the sheets; the night was warm enough as it was. She let her head rest against the pillow and cast her gaze towards the ceiling. The same ceiling she’d stared at every night for the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nIf all went well, she wouldn’t be seeing it again for a long time. \r\n\r\nMaybe ever.\r\n\r\nIf all went well.\r\n\r\nShe smiled and closed her eyes, and soon enough she’d drifted off to sleep.
